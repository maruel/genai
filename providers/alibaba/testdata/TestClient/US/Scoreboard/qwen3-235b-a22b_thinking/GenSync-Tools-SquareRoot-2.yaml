        body: '{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"363.89","reasoning_content":"Okay, let''s see. The user asked for the square root of 132413 using the square_root tool. I called the tool with that number, and the response was 363.89. Now I need to present this result. The user specified to reply only with the result and not include any explanation.\n\nFirst, I should verify if 363.89 squared is approximately 132413. Let me check that. 363.89 multiplied by 363.89. Hmm, 360 squared is 129600. Then, 3.89 squared is about 15.13. The cross term would be 2*360*3.89 = 2*360*3 + 2*360*0.89 = 2160 + 640.8 = 2800.8. Adding them up: 129600 + 2800.8 + 15.13  132415.93. That''s very close to 132413, considering rounding. So the answer seems accurate to two decimal places.\n\nSince the user wants only the result, I should just state 363.89 without any additional text. But wait, maybe the square_root tool''s output is already precise enough. The user might be expecting a more exact value, but the tool returned 363.89. Perhaps that''s the rounded value. I should confirm if the tool truncates or rounds, but since the response was 363.89, I''ll stick with that. So the final answer is 363.89.","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"logprobs":null}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":83,"completion_tokens":394,"total_tokens":477,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":383}},"created":1772142371,"system_fingerprint":null,"model":"qwen3-235b-a22b","id":"chatcmpl-WRc7R-vmnTTICM60"}'
