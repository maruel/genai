The schema requires a boolean value for \"is_fruit\". I need to recall if a banana is classified as a fruit. From what I know, in botanical terms, a fruit is the mature ovary of a flowering plant. Bananas do develop from the flowering part of the plant and contain seeds, even though they're usually seedless in grocery stores. So yes, a banana is a fruit. The answer should be {\"is_fruit\": true}. I need to make sure I'm not confusing it with a vegetable, which is a common misconception. But botanically, it's a fruit. The user didn't want any explanation, so just the JSON as specified.\n"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.198335036,"prompt_tokens":58,"prompt_time":0.002006284,"completion_tokens":170,"completion_time":0.366922267,"total_tokens":228,"total_time":0.368928551},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_f17c2eb555","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k0fjk37xe5k8grzqhp1egng4"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
