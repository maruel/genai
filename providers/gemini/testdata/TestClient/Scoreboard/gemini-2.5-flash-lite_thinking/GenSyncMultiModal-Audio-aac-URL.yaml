I need to focus on the content associated with \\\"00:00\\\".\\n\\nThe transcript provided has a timestamp \\\"00:00\\\" immediately followed by the word \\\"zero\\\". That's a direct correlation. Given the requirement to isolate the single word at that time, and the clear correspondence between timestamp and word, the answer is undoubtedly \\\"zero\\\".
