I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to arrive at the correct answer.\\n\\n### Understanding the Problem\\n\\nWe have two pieces of information:\\n\\n1. **The capital of Quackiland is Quack.**\\n2. **The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack.**\\n\\nThen, the question is: **What is the capital of Quackiland?**\\n\\nAt first glance, this seems straightforward, but let's examine it more carefully to ensure there's no trick or hidden complexity.\\n\\n### Analyzing the Given Information\\n\\n1. **First Statement: \\\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\\\"**\\n   - This directly tells us that Quack is the capital city of the country (or region) named Quackiland.\\n\\n2. **Second Statement: \\\"The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack.\\\"**\\n   - This provides additional information about Quack, specifically that there's a notable statue called the Big Canard Statue situated there. However, this seems like supplementary detail that might not directly impact the question being asked.\\n\\n### The Question: \\\"What is the capital of Quackiland?\\\"\\n\\nGiven the first statement, the answer seems to be directly provided: **Quack**.\\n\\nBut let's consider if there's any ambiguity or if the second statement changes anything.\\n\\n### Checking for Ambiguity or Tricks\\n\\nSometimes, wordplay or alternative meanings can complicate seemingly simple questions. Let's explore:\\n\\n- **Quack**: This can refer to the sound a duck makes, but in this context, it's clearly the name of a city.\\n- **Quackiland**: This sounds like a playful or fictional name for a country, possibly inspired by \\\"duck\\\" (since \\\"quack\\\" is a duck sound).\\n- **Big Canard Statue**: \\\"Canard\\\" is French for \\\"duck.\\\" So, the Big Canard Statue is essentially the \\\"Big Duck Statue.\\\"\\n\\nGiven this, the names seem to be playing on the theme of ducks, but that doesn't change the factual information provided.\\n\\n### Verifying the Answer\\n\\nThe question is asking for the capital of Quackiland, and the first statement explicitly states that it's Quack. The second statement adds a detail about Quack but doesn't contradict or change the capital's name.\\n\\n### Potential Missteps\\n\\nOne might wonder if the second statement implies that Quack isn't the capital, but that would contradict the first statement. Alternatively, someone might think that \\\"Canard\\\" being French for \\\"duck\\\" suggests a language-based answer, but the question is straightforward in English.\\n\\nAnother angle is to consider if \\\"Quack\\\" is a nickname or if there's another name for the capital, but the information doesn't suggest that.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nAfter carefully considering all parts of the information and the question, the most straightforward and correct answer is:\\n\\n**The capital of Quackiland is Quack.**\"}}]}"
