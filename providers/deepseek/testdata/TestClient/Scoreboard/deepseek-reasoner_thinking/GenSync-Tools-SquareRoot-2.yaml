We already saw 363.89^2 is about 132415.9321, which is too high.\n\n So the square root of 132413 is between 363.885 and 363.89.\n\n We can use a calculator or a more precise method.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the decimal module for better precision, but the problem requires only two decimal places.\n\n Actually, we are to round to two decimal places. So we need to see if the third decimal is 5 or above.\n\n We have:\n 363.885^2 = 132412.293225\n 363.890^2 = 132415.9321\n\n We are looking for 132413.\n\n The difference from 363.885^2 to 132413 is 132413 - 132412.293225 = 0.706775.\n\n The increment per 0.001 in the root is about 2*363.885*0.001 = 0.72777.\n\n So we need to add 0.706775 / 0.72777 ≈ 0.971 (thousandths) -> so about 363.885 + 0.001*0.971 ≈ 363.88597.\n\n Therefore, the square root of 132413 is approximately 363.886 when rounded to three decimal places.\n\n Now, rounding to two decimal places: look at the third decimal which is 6 (from 363.886), so we round up the second decimal from 8 to 9? \n But wait: 363.886 is actually 363.89 when rounded to two decimal places? \n\n Let's break down:\n 363.88597 -> the third decimal is 5, and then 9 (so actually 363.88597 has the third decimal as 5 and then 9, so we look at the thousandths place: 5, and then the next digit is 9 which is >=5, so we round up the hundredths place.\n\n However, note: rounding 363.88597 to two decimal places:\n   - The digit in the thousandths place is 5, and then there are more digits (9 and 7) so we round up the hundredths place (which is 8) to 9.\n\n But 363.88597 rounded to two decimal places:\n   - 363.88 is the number up to hundredths, then the thousandths is 5, so we round up the 8 to 9? \n   - Actually, 363.88 is 363.880, and then we have 597 in the thousandths and beyond. Since the thousandths is 5 and the next digit is 9 (>=5), we round up the hundredths digit (8) to 9, so we get 363.89.\n\n However, 363.89 squared is 132415.9321, which is greater than 132413.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider that the square root of 132413 is actually a bit less than 363.89.\n\n How about we compute more precisely?\n\n We can use the math module to get a more accurate value and then round.\n\n Let me compute with Python:\n\n Without having to run actual code, I know that:\n\n import math\n value = math.sqrt(132413)\n value = 363.886 (approximately)\n\n Then rounding 363.886 to two decimal places: \n   - The third decimal is 6, which is >=5, so we round up the second decimal from 8 to 9 -> 363.89.\n\n But let me check the exact calculation:\n\n 363.89^2 = 363.89 * 363.89:\n   Let me do the multiplication:\n     363.89\n   x 363.89\n   ---------\n     327501   (363.89 * 0.09)\n    2911120    (363.89 * 0.8 * 10) -> actually, better to break it.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   (363.89)^2 = (363 + 89/100)^2 = 363^2 + 2*363*(89/100) + (89/100)^2\n   = 131769 + 2*363*0.89 + (0.89)^2\n   = 131769 + 646.14 + 0.7921\n   = 131769 + 646.14 = 132415.14 + 0.7921 = 132415.9321\n\n Now, 363.88^2 = (363 + 88/100)^2\n   = 131769 + 2*363*0.88 + (0.88)^2\n   = 131769 + 638.88 + 0.7744 = 132407.88 + 0.7744 = 132408.6544\n\n The actual number 132413 is between 363.88^2 and 363.89^2.\n\n We want to round the true value to two decimal places. The true value is about 363.88597.\n\n The rule for rounding: look at the third decimal digit, which is 5, and then there are non-zero digits after (so we consider it as above 5?).\n\n Actually, standard rounding: if the digit in the third decimal is 5 and there are non-zero digits after, we round up.\n\n So 363.88597 becomes 363.89 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n However, we must check: the exact sqrt(132413) might be irrational, but we can compute with more precision.\n\n Using a calculator:\n   sqrt(132413) = 363.885971... \n\n So the third decimal is 5, the fourth is 9, which is >=5, so we round up the third decimal to 6? and then for two decimal places we look at the third decimal which is 5 (but then we see the 9, so we round up the second decimal from 8 to 9).\n\n Actually, when rounding to two decimal places, we look at the third decimal, which is 5, and then we see that there is a 9 after (so the value is more than 0.005), so we round up the hundredths place.\n\n Therefore, 363.88597... rounded to two decimal places is 363.89.\n\n However, note that 363.89 squared is 132415.9321, which is greater than 132413. This is because we rounded up. The actual square root is less than 363.89, but when rounded to two decimal places, it is 363.89.\n\n There is a nuance: the rounding rule says to round half up, but here we have more than half (because the third decimal is 5 and then there are more digits). So we round up.\n\n So the answer is 363.89.\n\n But let me check with a more precise computation:\n\n We can compute the square root by the Babylonian method or use a known value.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   Let x = sqrt(132413)\n   x = 363.885971...\n\n   Rounding 363.885971 to two decimal places:\n      The digits are: 3 6 3 . 8 8 5 9 7 1 ...\n      The third decimal is 5, and then 9 which is >=5, so we round the second decimal (8) up to 9 -> 363.89.\n\n Therefore, we output 363.89.\n\n However, let me verify with a different method:\n\n   We can compute: \n     363.885^2 = 363.885 * 363.885\n     = (363.885)^2 = 363.885 * 363.885\n\n     Let me compute step by step:\n\n        363.885\n      * 363.885\n      ----------\n        363.885 * 0.005 = 1.819425\n        363.885 * 0.08   = 29.1108\n        363.885 * 0.8    = 291.108\n        363.885 * 3      = 1091.655\n        ... actually, better to do:\n\n        (360+3.885)^2 = 360^2 + 2*360*3.885 + 3.885^2\n        = 129600 + 2797.2 + 15.093225\n        = 129600 + 2797.2 = 132397.2 + 15.093225 = 132412.293225\n\n      Now, 363.886^2 = 363.885^2 + 2*363.885*0.001 + (0.001)^2\n        = 132412.293225 + 0.72777 + 0.000001\n        = 132413.020996\n\n      This is already above 132413.\n\n      So the exact square root is between 363.885 and 363.886.\n\n      Therefore, 363.8855 would be the midpoint.\n\n      Let me compute 363.8855^2:\n\n        = (363.885 + 0.0005)^2\n        = 363.885^2 + 2*363.885*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2\n        = 132412.293225 + 0.363885 + 0.00000025\n        = 132412.65711025\n\n      This is less than 132413.\n\n      Then 363.8857^2:\n        = 363.885^2 + 2*363.885*0.0007 + (0.0007)^2\n        = 132412.293225 + 0.509439 + 0.00000049\n        = 132412.80266449\n\n      Still less.\n\n      363.886^2 = 132413.020996 (as above) -> greater.\n\n      So we need between 363.8857 and 363.886.\n\n      Therefore, the square root is 363.8858... (somewhere).\n\n      Now, rounding 363.8858 to two decimal places: look at the third decimal which is 5 (from 363.8858) and the next digit is 8, which is >=5, so we round up the second decimal from 8 to 9 -> 363.89.\n\n Therefore, the result is 363.89.\n\n However, note that the example in the problem for the square root of 132413 was given as 363.89 in the tool output example.\n\n So we output: 363.89\n\n But wait, the example output in the problem was for 132413? Actually, the example in the problem was:\n\n   square_root({\"number\": 132413}) -> 363.89\n\n So we are consistent.\n\n Conclusion: The square root of 132413 is 363.89 (when rounded to two decimal places)."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":68,"completion_tokens":2921,"total_tokens":2989,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":2916},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":68},"system_fingerprint":"fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache"}
