The question is asking for the capital of Quackiland. The problem statement says, \\\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack. The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. What is the capital of Quackiland?\\\"\\n\\nHmm, so first, they directly state that the capital of Quackiland is Quack. Then they mention the Big Canard Statue is in Quack, but that might just be extra information. The question is repeating the same thing, asking for the capital again.\\n\\nWait, maybe this is a trick question? Sometimes these puzzles try to mislead you with additional details. But here, the first sentence clearly says the capital is Quack. The second sentence about the statue is probably just there to test if you get distracted. So the answer should be Quack.\\n\\nBut let me double-check. The user is asking \\\"What is the capital of Quackiland?\\\" and the first line says \\\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\\\" So it's straightforward. Maybe they're testing attention to detail. No need to overcomplicate. The answer is Quack.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of Quackiland is explicitly stated in the question itself: **\\\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\\\"** The mention of the Big Canard Statue is additional context but does not alter the factual statement about the capital. \\n\\n**Answer:** Quack.\",\n        \"tool_calls\": [],\n        \"reasoning\": null\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\",\n      \"seed\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 45,\n    \"total_tokens\": 334,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 289\n  }\n}"
