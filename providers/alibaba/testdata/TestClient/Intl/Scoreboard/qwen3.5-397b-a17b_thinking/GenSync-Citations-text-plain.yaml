No, it''s a straightforward reading comprehension task.\n    *   Is the information contradictory? No.\n    *   Does the user want a full sentence or just the name? Usually, a direct answer is best, possibly in a complete sentence for politeness/clarity.\n\n5.  **Final Output Construction:**\n    *   \"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\"\n\n6.  **Final Check:** Does this answer the prompt accurately based *only* on the provided text?
