First, I need to check the search results to confirm the correct classification.\n\nLooking at the sources, both [1] and [2] mention that botanically, bananas are considered berries. However, all berries are a subset of fruits. Source [4] and [6] explicitly state that bananas meet the botanical criteria for berries, which are a type of fruit. Even though berries are a specific category within fruits, the general classification as a fruit still holds. The user wants a simple JSON answer, so the answer should be \"yes.\" I need to make sure that the JSON structure is correct, using lowercase keys and standard formatting without any additional comments or explanations.\n</think>\n\n{\"is_fruit\": true}"}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
