Let me check the search results for single-word greetings.\n\nLooking at the first result from Berlitz, they mention \"Hello\" and \"Hi\" as primary options. The pronunciation differences are there, but both are single words. [1]\n\nResult 2 from Duolingo lists \"Hello\" as a formal option and \"Hi\" as informal, along with \"Hey\" as very casual. [2]\n\nResult 3 from Language Tool explicitly states \"Hey\" is a direct synonym for \"Hello\" but casual. [3]\n\nResult 5 from Preply also notes using \"Hey\" with friends, but \"Hello\" is the standard one-word greeting. [5]\n\nThesaurus.com in result 4 has a list of synonyms like \"bow,\" \"nod,\" etc., but those are actions, not spoken words. So not applicable here.\n\nSo the options are \"Hello,\" \"Hi,\" and \"Hey.\" All are single words and serve the purpose. Since the user wants only one word, these are the candidates. The most formal is \"Hello,\" followed by \"Hi,\" then \"Hey.\" But since the query doesn''t specify formality, listing all three makes sense. However, the user might prefer the most common one. But according to the search results, \"Hello\" is the standard. But the answer should list all possible single-word greetings from the sources. Let me confirm:\n\nFrom result 1: \"Hello\" and \"Hi.\" [1]\n\nResult 2: \"Hello,\" \"Hi,\" \"Hey.\" [2]\n\nResult 3: \"Hello\" and \"Hey.\" [3]\n\nSo combining all, the valid one-word options are Hello, Hi, Hey. The answer should present these as the possible responses. But the user said \"use only one word,\" which could mean pick one, but maybe list all possible. The question is a bit ambiguous. But given the instruction, perhaps the response should list all single-word greetings from the search results. Therefore, the answer includes Hello, Hi, and Hey as the valid one-word options, citing the relevant sources.\n</think>\n\n**Possible responses:**  \n- **Hello** (standard formal greeting)[1][2]  \n- **Hi** (casual alternative)[1][2]  \n- **Hey** (informal version for friends/acquaintances)[2][3]  \n\nThese single-word greetings vary in formality, with \"Hello\" being the most neutral and \"Hey\" the most relaxed[1][2][3]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
