I can't treat them like a novice. I'll need to focus on the underlying *why* and the nuanced implications.  I'm thinking I'll start by establishing the core principle, the fundamental theorem if you will.  Then, I'll elaborate on its ramifications within the expert's specific domain, drawing parallels to familiar concepts to make it relatable. I need to showcase the intricacies, the \"edge cases\" as it were, and address the potential counterarguments or misconceptions that might arise.  The goal isn't just to *explain*, but to *deepen* their existing understanding and hopefully provoke some insightful internal dialogue on their part.  Ultimately, this explanation should serve as a springboard for further exploration. It should spark new ideas and applications within the user's expertise.\n",
