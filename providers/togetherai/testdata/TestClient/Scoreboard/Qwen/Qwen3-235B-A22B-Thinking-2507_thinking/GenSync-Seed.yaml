Maybe they're testing if I follow instructions precisely, or perhaps they're in a hurry and want something quick. Could also be a language exercise—like seeing how AI handles constraints. \\n\\nThe user seems direct, no extra fluff in their query. Probably values efficiency. I should respect that by keeping it ultra-simple. \\\"Hello\\\" is the obvious choice—it's the standard greeting, polite, and fits the one-word rule perfectly. \\n\\n...Though part of me wants to say \\\"Hi\\\" since it's shorter, but \\\"hello\\\" feels more neutral and universally appropriate.
