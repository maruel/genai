First, I should look at the function signature provided. The function is called square_root and it takes a number as a string. So, the input should be \"132413\". \n\nI remember that the function returns the square root, so I just need to call it with the correct argument. I should make sure that the number is passed as a string, not a number, because the parameter specifies it as a string type.\n\nI'll structure the tool_call with the name as \"square_root\" and the arguments as an object containing \"number\" set to \"132413\".
