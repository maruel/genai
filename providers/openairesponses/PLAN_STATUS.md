# Implementation Status

## Completed

1. ✅ **Scaffolding** - Basic client structure with imports and Client struct
2. ✅ **Client struct and New function** - Complete with API key handling and configuration
3. ✅ **Request structures** - Full ResponseRequest with all API parameters
   - Input handling (simple text and complex message array)
   - All request options (instructions, tools, reasoning, etc.)
   - Proper conversion from genai.Messages to API format
4. ✅ **Response structures** - Complete ResponseResponse with all API fields
   - Output parsing with message extraction
   - Usage tracking and finish reason mapping
   - Error handling and incomplete response details
5. ✅ **Interface implementations** - Core genai interfaces implemented
   - Init() method for request initialization
   - SetStream() method for streaming support
   - ToResult() method for response conversion
6. ✅ **Scoreboard** - Basic scoreboard with OpenAI Responses API capabilities

6. ✅ **GenStream implementation** - Complete streaming support with event handling
   - Comprehensive ResponseStreamChunkResponse struct for all event types
   - Full processStreamPackets implementation handling all streaming events
   - Support for text deltas, tool calls, errors, and completion events
   - Proper finish reason mapping from API status to genai types
7. ✅ **ProviderModel interface** - ListModels functionality through base.ProviderGen
8. ✅ **Code compilation** - All compilation issues resolved
   - Fixed type parameter mismatch in Client struct
   - Added missing imports and field access corrections
   - Proper status-to-finish-reason conversion

## Current Status

- Code compiles successfully ✅
- GenSync functionality works via base.ProviderGen ✅
- GenStream functionality implemented with full event handling ✅
- Request/response conversion implemented for text conversations ✅
- Streaming support with proper chunk processing ✅
- Ready for testing with both sync and streaming operations ✅

## TODO (Next Steps)

1. ⏳ **Tool calling support refinement** - Enhanced function definitions and tool call handling
2. ⏳ **Multi-modal support** - Image and file input handling
3. ⏳ **Advanced features** - Reasoning, citations, background processing
4. ⏳ **Testing** - Unit tests and smoke tests
5. ⏳ **Error handling refinement** - Better error messages and edge cases

## Notes

- Using the new OpenAI Responses API (https://api.openai.com/v1/responses)
- Supports both simple text input and complex message arrays
- Implements conversion between genai types and OpenAI Responses API format
- Full streaming implementation with comprehensive event handling
- Supports text streaming, tool calls, and error handling in streaming mode
- Ready for both synchronous and asynchronous operations
