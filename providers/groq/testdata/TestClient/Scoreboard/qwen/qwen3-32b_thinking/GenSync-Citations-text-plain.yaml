The user is asking, \\\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack. The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. What is the capital of Quackiland?\\\" Hmm, wait a second, the first part already states that the capital is Quack. Then they mention the Big Canard Statue being in Quack. But the question asks again about the capital.\\n\\nSo maybe this is a trick question where they try to make you read carefully. The key here is that the question is asking for the capital of Quackiland, which is already given in the first sentence as Quack. The second sentence about the statue is probably a distraction or red herring. Even though the statue's name includes \\\"Canard,\\\" which might sound like \\\"duck\\\" in French, but in the context of Quackiland, maybe \\\"Quack\\\" and \\\"Canard\\\" are related as the same word? Like \\\"canard\\\" means duck in French, and Quack is a duck sound. So maybe it's a play on words.\\n\\nWait, the problem states that Quack is the capital, and the statue is in Quack. The question is still asking for the capital again. The answer is right there in the first sentence. The mention of the Big Canard Statue is just additional info but doesn't change the capital. So the answer must be Quack. But let me make sure there's no trick here. Sometimes questions use similar-sounding words to confuse. Here, \\\"Canard\\\" and \\\"Quack\\\" might be related because canard is duck in French, and quack is a duck's sound. So maybe Quackiland is a country themed around ducks. Therefore, the capital remains Quack as stated. Yep, I think the answer is straightforward. The user just needs to recognize that the question is repeating the setup and the answer is already provided.\\n\\u003c/think\\u003e\\n\\nThe question provides that the capital of Quackiland is **Quack** at the outset. The mention of the Big Canard Statue located in Quack is additional context and does not affect the answer. \\n\\n**Answer:** The capital of Quackiland is **Quack**.\"},\"logprobs\":null,\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"queue_time\":0.074944235,\"prompt_tokens\":39,\"prompt_time\":0.001437354,\"completion_tokens\":453,\"completion_time\":1.093316386,\"total_tokens\":492,\"total_time\":1.09475374},\"usage_breakdown\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_d58dbe76cd\",\"x_groq\":{\"id\":\"req_01kcc47tmfe71apd20c7gz5ds2\",\"seed\":769979395},\"service_tier\":\"on_demand\"}\n"
