First, I should look at the function signature provided. It says the function is called square_root and it takes a parameter called \"number\" which is a string. \n\nWait, the parameter is a string? That's a bit unusual because typically numbers are handled as integers or floats, but maybe it's designed that way for some reason. So, I need to make sure that I pass 132413 as a string inside the arguments.\n\nI should structure the tool call correctly. The function name is \"square_root\" and the arguments should be a JSON object with the key \"number\" and the value as the string \"132413\". \n\nSo the tool call should look like this:\n\n{\"name\": \"square_root\", \"arguments\": {\"number\": \"132413\"}}\n\nI think that's all I need to do. I don't need to handle any calculations myself since the tool is supposed to compute the square root. I just have to make sure the input is in the correct format as specified by the function's parameters.\n\nLet me double-check the function signature again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The function expects a string for the number, so passing \"132413\" is correct. I don't need to convert it to an integer or float in this case.\n\nAlso, the instructions say to reply with only the result, so once I get the response from the tool, I should extract the square root value and present it without any additional explanation or formatting.\n\nAlright, I think I'm ready to make the tool call as specified.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"avym265hq","type":"function","function":{"name":"square_root","arguments":"{\"number\":\"132413\"}"}}]},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.009541753,"prompt_tokens":181,"prompt_time":0.011300733,"completion_tokens":361,"completion_time":1.329944116,"total_tokens":542,"total_time":1.341244849},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_87eae35036","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k0qpg5vfea6t0qgf541yss72"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
