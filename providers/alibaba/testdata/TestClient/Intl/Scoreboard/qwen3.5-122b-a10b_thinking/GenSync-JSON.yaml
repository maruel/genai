Yes, botanically and culinarily, a banana is considered a fruit (specifically a berry).\n    *   Value for `is_fruit`: `true`.\n\n3.  **Format the Output:**\n    *   Must be valid JSON.\n    *   Must match the schema `{\"is_fruit\": bool}`.\n    *   No markdown code blocks (unless implied by \"ONLY as JSON\", but usually raw JSON is safer to avoid extra characters). However, often users accept markdown blocks. The instruction says \"Reply ONLY as JSON\". I will output raw JSON text to be strict.\n    *   No explanations, no introductory text.\n\n4.  **Construct the JSON:**\n    *   `{\"is_fruit\": true}`\n\n5.  **Final Review:**\n    *   Does it answer the question? Yes.\n    *   Is it JSON? Yes.\n    *   Is there any explanation? No.\n    *   Does it match the schema? Yes.\n\n6.  **Generate Output.**\n    {\"is_fruit\": true}","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"logprobs":null}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":41,"completion_tokens":326,"total_tokens":367,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":315,"text_tokens":326},"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":41}},"created":1772220861,"system_fingerprint":null,"model":"qwen3.5-122b-a10b","id":"chatcmpl-ae9e14cd-bc0e-9ea6-ae64-618e6c17810d"}'
