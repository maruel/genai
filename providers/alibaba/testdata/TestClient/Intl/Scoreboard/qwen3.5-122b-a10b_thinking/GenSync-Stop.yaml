        body: '{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Canada ","reasoning_content":"Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   Topic: Canada.\n    *   Requirement: \"In great details.\"\n    *   Constraint: Start with the exact phrase \"Canada is\".\n\n2.  **Determine the Scope and Structure:**\n    *   To cover Canada in \"great details,\" I need to touch upon multiple facets: geography, history, politics, economy, culture, demographics, lifestyle, natural resources, international role, etc.\n    *   The structure should be logical and flowing.\n    *   Since the prompt asks for \"great details,\" a single paragraph might be too condensed. I should aim for a comprehensive overview, possibly broken down into sections (though still maintaining a cohesive essay style or clearly delineated sections) to ensure depth.\n    *   *Self-Correction on Format:* The prompt says \"Start with: Canada is\". It doesn''t explicitly forbid subsequent paragraphs, but starting the very first sentence with that phrase is mandatory. I will write a long-form response that explores various dimensions of the country.\n\n3.  **Drafting - Section by Section:**\n\n    *   **Introduction/Geography:** Start with the required phrase. Define what it is (country, location). Mention size (2nd largest), borders (USA, oceans), climate diversity.\n    *   **History:** Indigenous peoples, French/British colonization, Confederation (1867), evolution to sovereignty, immigration waves.\n    *   **Political System:** Constitutional monarchy, parliamentary democracy, federalism (provinces/territories), head of state vs. head of government.\n    *   **Economy:** Natural resources (oil, minerals, timber), trade (USMCA), technology, services, banking stability.\n    *   **Demographics & Society:** Population density (low), urbanization (Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal), multiculturalism (official policy), immigration, indigenous rights/reconciliation.\n    *   **Culture:** Arts, literature, music, sports (hockey, lacrosse), bilingualism (English/French), symbols (maple leaf).\n    *   **Environment/Nature:** National parks, wilderness, wildlife, climate change challenges (Arctic, boreal forest).\n    *   **International Relations:** NATO, G7, UN, peacekeeping, soft power.\n\n4.  **Refining the Content (Adding Detail):**\n    *   *Geography:* Mention the 10 provinces and 3 territories. Mention specific landforms (Rockies, Great Lakes, Shield).\n    *   *History:* Mention the fur trade, War of 1812, Statute of Westminster.\n    *   *Politics:* Mention Governor General, Prime Minister, Senate/House.\n    *   *Economy:* Mention Calgary, Toronto, tech hubs.\n    *   *Culture:* Mention Céline Dion, Drake, Margaret Atwood (optional but nice), Hockey Night in Canada.\n    *   *Social Policies:* Healthcare (Medicare), gun control, cannabis legalization.\n\n5.  **Review against Constraints:**\n    *   Does it start with \"Canada is\"? Yes.\n    *   Is it detailed? Yes, covering many aspects.\n    *   Is the tone appropriate? Informative, objective, respectful.\n\n6.  **Drafting the Response (Mental or Scratchpad):**\n    *   *Opening:* Canada is... the second-largest country by total area... located in North America...\n    *   *Body:* Weave in the details. Don''t just list facts; explain them. Talk about the vastness, the cold winters but also varied climates (Vancouver vs. Labrador). Talk about the duality of English and French.\n    *   *Ending:* Summarize its global standing.\n\n7.  **Final Polish:** Check for flow and ensure the starting phrase is exact. (Wait, check if there are any safety guidelines regarding sensitive topics like Indigenous issues or political controversies. Keep it factual and balanced.)\n\n    *   *Constraint Check:* \"Start with: Canada is\". I must ensure no introductory text precedes this.\n\n8.  **Execution:** (Proceeding to generate the text based on the plan.)\n\n    *   *Sentence 1:* Canada is...\n    *   *Expansion:* Go deep into provinces, history, economy, culture.\n\n    *(Self-Correction during drafting)*: Make sure not to make it *too* dry. Add some context about the quality of life and societal values. Ensure the distinction between Crown colony history and modern independence is clear.\n\n    *Let''s structure it logically:*\n    1. Geography & Climate\n    2. History & Indigenous Roots\n    3. Government & Politics\n    4. Economy & Industry\n    5. Society, Culture & Demographics\n    6. International Role\n\n    *Wait, one continuous flow or distinct paragraphs?* Paragraphs are better for readability while maintaining the \"essay\" feel.\n\n    *Re-checking the starting phrase:* \"Canada is\" (case sensitive).\n\n    *Let''s write.*\n    (Drafting content...)\n    \"Canada is the second-largest sovereign nation...\"\n    \"Spanning from...\"\n    \"Its history begins with...\"\n    \"Politically...\"\n    \"Economically...\"\n    \"Culturally...\"\n    \"Finally...\"\n\n    *Make sure to include specific numbers where relevant (population, area).*\n    *Area: ~9.98 million sq km.*\n    *Population: ~40 million.*\n    *Capital: Ottawa.*\n    *Provinces/Territories count.*\n\n    *Okay, ready to generate.*","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"logprobs":null}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":22,"completion_tokens":1354,"total_tokens":1376,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":1195,"text_tokens":1354},"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":22}},"created":1772220857,"system_fingerprint":null,"model":"qwen3.5-122b-a10b","id":"chatcmpl-6da9bd5a-9d5f-9b68-8849-ee00b99574ea"}'
