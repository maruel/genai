Alright, first, I need to check if the tool is available. Looking back at the provided tools, there's a function called square_root that takes a number as a string parameter. So I should call that function with the number 132413. I need to make sure the input is correctly formatted as a string. Then, once I get the result from the tool, I'll just present it as is, without any additional text. Let me verify the parameters again to ensure I'm not making a mistake. The function requires \"number\" of type string. So the JSON should have \"number\": \"132413\". Yep, that looks right.
