The user mentioned that the capital is Quack and that there's a Big Canard Statue located there. I remember from previous interactions that the user provided this information, so it's probably the key point.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure I'm not missing anything. They said the capital is Quack, so that should be the straightforward answer. The Big Canard Statue is in Quack, which reinforces that Quack is indeed the capital. I don't think there's any additional information needed here. It seems pretty clear.\\n\\nI should just state the capital as Quack without adding any extra details unless the user asks for more. So, the answer is Quack.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of Quackiland is Quack.\",\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":38,\"completion_tokens\":168,\"total_tokens\":206}},\"success\":true,\"errors\":[],\"messages\":[]}"
