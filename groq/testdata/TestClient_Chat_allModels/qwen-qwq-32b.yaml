Let me make sure I understand the instructions correctly. They specified to use only one word and say only \"hello\". So I shouldn't add anything else. But sometimes people might get confused if there are any hidden requirements. Maybe they want it in a different language? But the instruction says \"Say hello\", so the word should be in English. Also, the user emphasized using only one word, so no extra words or punctuation. Just the word \"hello\". Let me check again: \"Use only one word. Say only hello.\" Yep, that's straightforward. I should respond with \"Hello\" and nothing else. No need for any explanations or anything else.
