I need to make sure I respond correctly. Let me think... The simplest way is to just say \"Hello\" as a single word. That fits the requirement of one word. I should check if there are any other possible one-word greetings, but \"Hello\" is the most straightforward. Let me confirm that \"Hello\" is indeed a single word and not a contraction or something. Yes, it's a single word without any additional letters or marks.
