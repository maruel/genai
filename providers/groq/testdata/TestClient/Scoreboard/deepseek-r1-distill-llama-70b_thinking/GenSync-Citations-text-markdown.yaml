Let me start by reading the information provided. The first sentence says, \\\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\\\" That seems pretty straightforward. Then it mentions that the Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. \\n\\nWait, so the capital is Quack, and there's a statue there. Maybe I should make sure I'm not confusing the capital with the statue's location. Sometimes, statues can be in different cities, but in this case, it's in Quack. So, the capital is Quack, and the statue is also there. \\n\\nI don't think there's any trick here. The question is directly asking for the capital, and the first sentence gives it away. I shouldn't overcomplicate it. Maybe the mention of the statue is just extra information to test if I'm paying attention. \\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the capital is clearly stated as Quack. The statue's location is just additional info but doesn't change the answer. I think that's it. No need to look for any hidden clues or alternative interpretations. The answer is right there in the first sentence.\\n\\u003c/think\\u003e\\n\\nThe capital of Quackiland is Quack.\"},\"logprobs\":null,\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"queue_time\":0.194425296,\"prompt_tokens\":37,\"prompt_time\":0.01248249,\"completion_tokens\":258,\"completion_time\":1.196791419,\"total_tokens\":295,\"total_time\":1.209273909},\"usage_breakdown\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_76307ac09b\",\"x_groq\":{\"id\":\"req_01k3xhqrs9e6tvv8a0avc4dff0\"},\"service_tier\":\"on_demand\"}\n"
