Special Relativity\\n\\n### 1.1. Fundamental Postulates  \\n\\n1. **Principle of Relativity** – The laws of physics are identical in all inertial (non‑accelerating) reference frames. No inertial frame is physically distinguished.  \\n2. **Constancy of the Speed of Light** – In vacuum, light travels at the same speed *c* (≈\u202f299\u202f792\u202f458\u202fm\u202fs⁻¹) for all observers, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer.\\n\\nThese two simple statements already imply profound changes to our notions of space and time.\\n\\n### 1.2. Core Consequences  \\n\\n| Phenomenon | Description |\\n|------------|-------------|\\n| **Relativity of Simultaneity** | Two events that are simultaneous in one inertial frame need not be simultaneous in another moving frame. |\\n| **Time Dilation** | A moving clock ticks slower than a stationary one. The factor is the Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1‑v²/c²). |\\n| **Length Contraction** | Objects contract along the direction of motion by the same factor γ. |\\n| **Mass–Energy Equivalence** | Energy and mass are interchangeable: **E\u202f=\u202fmc²** (more precisely, E²\u202f=\u202f(p\u202fc)²\u202f+\u202f(m\u202fc²)²). |\\n| **Maximum Speed** | No material object, signal or information can travel faster than *c*. |\\n\\n### 1.3. Lorentz Transformations  \\n\\nThe mathematical backbone of SR replaces the Galilean transformations with the Lorentz transformations:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nt' \\u0026= \\\\gamma\\\\!\\\\left(t - \\\\frac{v x}{c^{2}}\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\nx' \\u0026= \\\\gamma\\\\!\\\\left(x - v t\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\ny' \\u0026= y,\\\\qquad z' = z,\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere *v* is the relative velocity of the frames along the *x*‑axis.\\n\\n### 1.4. Experimental Confirmation  \\n\\n* **Michelson–Morley (1887)** – Null result for an “aether wind” supports the constancy of *c*.  \\n* **Kennedy–Thorndike (1932)** – Confirms that the round‑trip speed of light is independent of the laboratory’s velocity.  \\n* **Ives–Stilwell (1938, 1941)** – Directly measures the transverse Doppler shift, confirming time dilation.  \\n* **Modern Tests** – High‑precision atomic clocks on aircraft and satellites, particle‑accelerator data, and observations of muon lifetimes all verify SR to parts in 10⁻¹⁶.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. General Relativity\\n\\n### 2.1. From Inertia to Gravitation  \\n\\nEinstein realized that SR could not accommodate gravity because it forbids acceleration between inertial frames. The key insight was the **Equivalence Principle** (1907):\\n\\n\\u003e *The effects of a uniform gravitational field are locally indistinguishable from those of a uniformly accelerated reference frame.*\\n\\nThus, gravity is not a force in the Newtonian sense but a manifestation of spacetime geometry.\\n\\n### 2.2. Spacetime Curvature  \\n\\n- **Spacetime** is a four‑dimensional manifold with a metric tensor *g*₍μν₎ that defines distances and times.  \\n- **Mass‑energy tells spacetime how to curve**; curvature tells mass‑energy how to move. This relationship is encoded in the **Einstein Field Equations (EFE)**:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nR_{\\\\mu\\\\nu} - \\\\frac{1}{2}R\\\\,g_{\\\\mu\\\\nu} + \\\\Lambda g_{\\\\mu\\\\nu}\\n   = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi G}{c^{4}}\\\\,T_{\\\\mu\\\\nu},\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere  \\n* *R*₍μν₎ – Ricci curvature tensor,  \\n* *R* – Ricci scalar,  \\n* *Λ* – cosmological constant,  \\n* *G* – Newton’s gravitational constant,  \\n* *T*₍μν₎ – stress‑energy tensor (distribution of mass‑energy and momentum).\\n\\nThese ten coupled, non‑linear partial differential equations determine the metric *g*₍μν₎ for a given distribution of matter and energy.\\n\\n### 2.3. Key Predictions \\u0026 Phenomena  \\n\\n| Phenomenon | Explanation in GR |\\n|------------|-------------------|\\n| **Gravitational Time Dilation** | Clocks deeper in a gravitational potential run slower (e.g., GPS satellite clocks). |\\n| **Light Deflection (Gravitational Lensing)** | Light follows null geodesics that bend around massive bodies; first observed during the 1919 solar eclipse. |\\n| **Perihelion Precession of Mercury** | The elliptical orbit of Mercury advances by ~43\u202farcseconds per century beyond Newtonian prediction. |\\n| **Gravitational Redshift** | Photons lose energy climbing out of a gravity well, shifting to longer wavelengths. |\\n| **Frame‑Dragging (Lense–Thirring Effect)** | Rotating masses “drag” spacetime around them; measured by Gravity Probe\u202fB. |\\n| **Black Holes** | Solutions such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics describe regions where curvature becomes infinite and nothing, not even light, can escape. |\\n| **Gravitational Waves** | Ripples in spacetime propagating at *c*; directly detected by LIGO/Virgo (2015 onward). |\\n| **Cosmological Expansion** | The Friedmann‑Lemaître‑Robertson‑Walker (FLRW) metric, derived from the EFE, predicts an expanding universe (Hubble’s law). |\\n\\n### 2.4. Experimental Tests  \\n\\n- **Classical Tests** (1915‑1930s): Mercury’s perihelion, light bending, gravitational redshift.  \\n- **Modern Tests**:  \\n  * **Shapiro Delay** – Time delay of radar signals passing near the Sun.  \\n  * **Binary Pulsars** – Orbital decay matches energy loss via gravitational waves.  \\n  * **Gravity Probe\u202fB** – Measured geodetic and frame‑dragging precessions.  \\n  * **LIGO/Virgo** – Direct detection of gravitational waves from binary black‑hole and neutron‑star mergers.  \\n\\nAll results agree with GR predictions to extraordinary precision (often better than 0.1\u202f%).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Mathematical Tools\\n\\n| Tool | Role in Relativity |\\n|------|--------------------|\\n| **Tensor Calculus** | Provides coordinate‑independent description of physical laws; essential for the EFE. |\\n| **Differential Geometry** | Describes curvature (Riemann, Ricci tensors) and geodesics (paths of free‑fall). |\\n| **Minkowski Space** | Flat spacetime of SR; metric η₍μν₎ = diag(−1,\u202f+1,\u202f+1,\u202f+1). |\\n| **Riemannian Geometry** | Generalizes to curved spacetime in GR. |\\n| **Lorentz Group** | Symmetry group of SR; underlies relativistic invariance. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Practical Applications\\n\\n1. **Global Positioning System (GPS)** – Requires both SR (satellite clocks run faster due to their speed) and GR (clocks run slower in weaker Earth gravity) corrections; otherwise positioning errors would accumulate at ~10\u202fkm per day.  \\n2. **Particle Accelerators** – Relativistic mass‑energy relation dictates design of synchrotrons and colliders (e.g., LHC).  \\n3. **Astronomy \\u0026 Cosmology** – Modeling of stellar evolution, black‑hole dynamics, gravitational lensing, and the expanding universe all rely on GR.  \\n4. **Timekeeping** – Optical lattice clocks achieve 10⁻¹⁸ fractional uncertainty, where relativistic height differences of a few centimeters become measurable.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Historical Context\\n\\n| Year | Milestone |\\n|------|-----------|\\n| **1905** | Einstein’s *Annalen der Physik* paper “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies” – introduces SR. |\\n| **1907** | “Happiest thought”: the equivalence principle, the seed of GR. |\\n| **1915** | Einstein presents the final field equations to the Prussian Academy (Nov\u202f25). |\\n| **1916** | Publication of the full GR theory. |\\n| **1919** | Eddington’s eclipse expedition confirms light bending – Einstein becomes a worldwide celebrity. |\\n| **1960s‑70s** | Revival of GR: discovery of quasars, pulsars, cosmic microwave background, and development of numerical relativity. |\\n| **2015** | First direct detection of gravitational waves (GW150914) by LIGO, confirming a century‑old prediction. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6.

General relativity extends this picture by allowing spacetime to be curved by mass‑energy, providing a geometric description of gravity that predicts phenomena from black holes to the expansion of the universe and has been confirmed by a century of increasingly precise experiments.\",\"reasoning\":\"\\nThe theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, is a fundamental concept in modern physics that has revolutionized our understanding of space and time. It consists of two main components: special relativity and general relativity.\\n\\nSpecial relativity posits that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. This theory challenged the long-held notion of absolute time and space. \\n\\nOne of the key principles of special relativity is that the speed of light is constant and unchanging for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. This leads to several important consequences, including:\\n\\n1. Time dilation: Time appears to pass more slowly for an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer.\\n2. Length contraction: Objects appear shorter to an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer.\\n3. Relativity of simultaneity: Two events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be simultaneous for another observer in a different state of motion.\\n\\nThe famous equation E=mc^2, which relates energy and mass, is a direct result of special relativity.\\n\\nGeneral relativity builds upon special relativity and introduces the concept of gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. According to this theory, the curvature of spacetime around a massive object such as the Earth causes objects to fall towards the center of the Earth, which we experience as gravity.\\n\\nThe core principles of general relativity include:\\n\\n1. The equivalence principle: The effects of gravity are equivalent to the effects of acceleration.\\n2. Geodesic equation: The shortest path through spacetime, called a geodesic, is a straight line in flat spacetime but a curved line in the presence of mass and energy.\\n\\nTo provide a more detailed explanation, let's consider some mathematical aspects of the theory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u003ctool\\u003e\\npython print(1+1)\\n\\u003c/tool\\u003e\\n\\u003coutput\\u003eError occurred: invalid command type, must be one of: python, search, visit\\u003c/output\\u003e\\n \\n\\nThe mathematical framework of relativity relies heavily on differential geometry and tensor analysis. \\n\\nThe Einstein field equations, which describe how mass and energy warp spacetime, are a set of 10 non-linear partial differential equations:\\n\\nRμν - 1/2Rgμν = (8πG/c^4)Tμν\\n\\nwhere Rμν is the Ricci tensor, R is the Ricci scalar, gμν is the metric tensor, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, and Tμν is the stress-energy tensor.\\n\\nThese equations can be used to predict phenomena such as gravitational waves and black holes.\\n\\nTo gain a deeper understanding, let's search for more information on the theory of relativity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u003ctool\\u003e\\nsearch(theory of relativity)\\n\\u003c/tool\\u003e\\n\\u003coutput\\u003eTitle: Theory of relativity\\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity\\nContent: The term \\\"theory of relativity\\\" was based on the expression \\\"relative theory\\\" (German: Relativtheorie) used in 1906 by Planck, who emphasized how the theory uses the principle of relativity. In the discussion section of the same paper, Alfred Bucherer used for the first time the expression \\\"theory of relativity\\\" (German: Relativitätstheorie). [...] Einstein explained that the theory of relativity falls under a category of scientific frameworks known as \\\"principle-theories\\\"—theories that start not from speculative constructs or imagined mechanisms, but from well-established empirical facts and observed regularities in nature. Unlike constructive theories, which attempt to build models of phenomena from assumed underlying processes, principle-theories, such as relativity, adopt an analytic approach: they begin with experimentally verified [...] Albert Einstein published the theory of special relativity in 1905, building on many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by Albert A.

Anxious that the new theory would also include gravitational effects, he realized to his delight in 1907 that these two ambitions were one and the same. This great insight – the equivalence principle – set Einstein on the long and difficult road to the general theory of relativity. [...] In his 1905 theory of relativity (later named the “special theory”), Einstein’s insistence that the laws of physics must appear identical to observers in uniform relative motion led to the prediction that space and time are neither independent nor absolute. Instead, observers travelling at high speed relative to one another would experience a given interval in space and time differently. Long before this startling prediction could be verified by experiment, Einstein had embarked on the quest [...] On 25 November 1915, as devastating war raged throughout Europe, Albert Einstein presented the paper Die Feldgleichungen der Gravitation (“The field equations of gravitation”) to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. This paper, the last in a series of four, marked the first consistent formulation of his general theory of relativity, a task that had challenged Einstein for almost a decade.

Albert Einstein proposed these theories starting in 1905. By the 1920s, they were widely accepted by physicists. [...] Special relativity describes how the universe works for objects that are not accelerating, called inertial reference frames. However, it doesn’t incorporate gravity. That’s part of the theory of general relativity. Before Einstein, the traditional view was that gravity was an invisible force pulling things together. Instead, general relativity states that gravity is how mass warps space and time. The bigger the mass, the more it warps things. Imagine that the universe is a rubber sheet covered [...] Special relativity involves two key ideas. First, the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for any observer, regardless of the observer’s location or motion, or the location or motion of the light source. Second, the laws of physics are the same for all reference frames that are not speeding up or slowing down relative to each other. A reference frame can be thought of as an environment in which an observer is at rest.

According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. [...] a while, Einstein thought that there were problems with the approach, but he later returned to it and, by late 1915, had published his general theory of relativity in the form in which it is used today. This theory explains gravitation as the distortion of the structure of spacetime by matter, affecting the inertial motion of other matter. [...] As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was the preference of inertial motion within special relativity, while a theory which from the outset prefers no particular state of motion appeared more satisfactory to him. So, while still working at the patent office in 1907, Einstein had what he would call his \\\"happiest thought\\\".

Electrodynamics actually needed no adjustment. Einstein's 1905 theory of relativity had been created to fit with the existing theory. The mechanics of bodies required adjustments to the notions of energy, momentum and mass. The most prominent of these was the famous equivalence E=mc2. Einstein also sketched a relativistic treatment of thermodynamics, the theory of heat and work. [...] Fortunately for Einstein, no measurement was taken. Einstein's theory of 1914 was not yet the complete general theory of relativity. In his earlier theory, there was no curvature of ordinary space in the vicinity of the sun. As a result, as we saw in another chapter, his theory predicted the same deflection as Newtonian gravitation theory (assuming light consists of massive corpuscles). It was half the deflection predicted by the final theory.

New mathematical techniques to apply to general relativity streamlined calculations and made its concepts more easily visualized.

It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper \\\"【57†On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies】\\\" (for the contributions of many other physicists and mathematicians, see 【58†History of special relativity】). Special relativity is based on two postulates which are contradictory in 【15†classical mechanics】:\\n\\n1. The 【59†laws of physics】 are the same for all observers in any 【60†inertial frame of reference】 relative to one another (【46†principle of relativity】).\\n2. The 【61†speed of light】 in 【62†vacuum】 is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or of the motion of the 【63†light】 source.\\n\\nThe resultant theory copes with experiment better than classical mechanics. For instance, postulate 2 explains the results of the 【64†Michelson–Morley experiment】. Moreover, the theory has many surprising and counterintuitive consequences. Some of these are:\\n\\n- 【20†Relativity of simultaneity】: Two events, simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another observer if the observers are in relative motion.\\n- 【22†Time dilation】: Moving 【65†clocks】 are measured to tick more slowly than an observer's \\\"stationary\\\" clock.\\n- 【23†Length contraction】: Objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.\\n- 【66†Maximum speed is finite】: No physical object, message or field line can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum.\\n  - The effect of gravity can only travel through space at the speed of light, not faster or instantaneously.\\n- 【67†Mass–energy equivalence】: 2 _E_ = _mc_, energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable.\\n 【68†\\\\[9\\\\]】- 【69†Relativistic mass】, idea used by some researchers.\\n\\nThe defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the 【70†Galilean transformations】 of classical mechanics by the 【71†Lorentz transformations】. (See 【72†Maxwell's equations】 of 【73†electromagnetism】.)\\n\\n## General relativity\\n\\n 【74†\\\\[10\\\\]】\\n\\nGeneral relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the 【75†equivalence principle】, under which the states of 【76†accelerated motion】 and being at rest in a 【9†gravitational field】 (for example, when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that 【77†free fall】 is 【78†inertial motion】: an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no 【79†force】 being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of 【9†gravity】 as is the case in 【15†classical mechanics】. This is incompatible with classical mechanics and 【7†special relativity】 because in those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to each other, but objects in free fall do so. To resolve this difficulty Einstein first proposed that 【80†spacetime is curved】. Einstein discussed his idea with mathematician 【81†Marcel Grossmann】 and they concluded that general relativity could be formulated in the context of 【82†Riemannian geometry】 which had been developed in the 1800s. In 1915, he devised the 【83†Einstein field equations】 which relate the curvature of spacetime with the mass, energy, and any momentum within it.\\n\\nSome of the consequences of general relativity are:\\n\\n【84†\\\\[11\\\\]】- 【85†Gravitational time dilation】: Clocks run slower in deeper gravitational wells.\\n- 【86†Precession】: Orbits precess in a way unexpected in Newton's theory of gravity. (This has been observed in the orbit of 【87†Mercury】 and in 【88†binary pulsars】).\\n- 【89†Light deflection】: Rays of 【63†light】 bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\\n- 【90†Frame-dragging】: Rotating masses \\\"drag along\\\" the 【1†spacetime】 around them.\\n- 【91†Expansion of the universe】: The universe is expanding, and certain components within the universe can 【92†accelerate the expansion】.\\n\\nTechnically, general relativity is a theory of 【93†gravitation】 whose defining feature is its use of the 【83†Einstein field equations】. The solutions of the field equations are 【94†metric tensors】 which define the 【95†topology】 of the spacetime and how objects move inertially.\\n\\n## Experimental evidence\\n\\n 【3†\\\\[2\\\\]】\\n\\nEinstein explained that the theory of relativity falls under a category of scientific frameworks known as \\\"principle-theories\\\"—theories that start not from speculative constructs or imagined mechanisms, but from well-established empirical facts and observed regularities in nature. Unlike constructive theories, which attempt to build models of phenomena from assumed underlying processes, principle-theories, such as relativity, adopt an analytic approach: they begin with experimentally verified principles and work deductively to uncover the logical consequences and constraints that any physical process must obey. By observing natural processes, we understand their general characteristics, devise mathematical models to describe what we observed, and by analytical means we deduce the necessary conditions that have to be satisfied. Measurement of separate events must satisfy these conditions and match the theory's conclusions.\\n\\n### Tests of special relativity\\n\\nA diagram of the 【64†Michelson–Morley experiment】 【96†\\\\[12\\\\]】\\n\\nRelativity is a 【97†falsifiable】 theory: It makes predictions that can be tested by experiment. In the case of special relativity, these include the principle of relativity, the constancy of the speed of light, and time dilation. The predictions of special relativity have been confirmed in numerous tests since Einstein published his paper in 1905, but three experiments conducted between 1881 and 1938 were critical to its validation. These are the 【64†Michelson–Morley experiment】, the 【98†Kennedy–Thorndike experiment】, and the 【99†Ives–Stilwell experiment】. Einstein derived the 【71†Lorentz transformations】 from first principles in 1905, but these three experiments allow the transformations to be induced from experimental evidence.\\n\\n22【100†\\\\[13\\\\]】【101†\\\\[14\\\\]】\\n\\n【72†Maxwell's equations】—the foundation of classical electromagnetism—describe light as a wave that moves with a characteristic velocity. The modern view is that light needs no medium of transmission, but Maxwell and his contemporaries were convinced that light waves were propagated in a medium, analogous to sound propagating in air, and ripples propagating on the surface of a pond. This hypothetical medium was called the 【102†luminiferous aether】, at rest relative to the \\\"fixed stars\\\" and through which the Earth moves. Fresnel's 【103†partial ether dragging hypothesis】 ruled out the measurement of first-order (v/c) effects, and although observations of second-order effects (v/c) were possible in principle, Maxwell thought they were too small to be detected with then-current technology.\\n\\n【104†\\\\[15\\\\]】【105†\\\\[16\\\\]】【101†\\\\[14\\\\]】【106†\\\\[17\\\\]】【107†\\\\[18\\\\]】【108†\\\\[19\\\\]】\\n\\nThe Michelson–Morley experiment was designed to detect second-order effects of the \\\"aether wind\\\"—the motion of the aether relative to the Earth. Michelson designed an instrument called the 【109†Michelson interferometer】 to accomplish this. The apparatus was sufficiently accurate to detect the expected effects, but he obtained a null result when the first experiment was conducted in 1881, and again in 1887. Although the failure to detect an aether wind was a disappointment, the results were accepted by the scientific community. In an attempt to salvage the aether paradigm, FitzGerald and Lorentz independently created an 【110†ad hoc hypothesis】 in which the length of material bodies changes according to their motion through the aether. This was the origin of 【111†FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction】, and their hypothesis had no theoretical basis. The interpretation of the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment is that the round-trip travel time for light is 【112†isotropic】 (independent of direction), but the result alone is not enough to discount the theory of the aether or validate the predictions of special relativity.\\n\\nThe 【98†Kennedy–Thorndike experiment】 shown with interference fringes 【113†\\\\[20\\\\]】【108†\\\\[19\\\\]】【114†\\\\[21\\\\]】【107†\\\\[18\\\\]】【108†\\\\[19\\\\]】\\n\\nWhile the Michelson–Morley experiment showed that the velocity of light is isotropic, it said nothing about how the magnitude of the velocity changed (if at all) in different 【115†inertial frames】. The Kennedy–Thorndike experiment was designed to do that, and was first performed in 1932 by Roy Kennedy and Edward Thorndike. They obtained a null result, and concluded that \\\"there is no effect ... unless the velocity of the solar system in space is no more than about half that of the earth in its orbit\\\". That possibility was thought to be too coincidental to provide an acceptable explanation, so from the null result of their experiment it was concluded that the round-trip time for light is the same in all inertial reference frames.\\n\\n【116†\\\\[22\\\\]】【117†\\\\[23\\\\]】【107†\\\\[18\\\\]】【108†\\\\[19\\\\]】\\n\\nThe Ives–Stilwell experiment was carried out by Herbert Ives and G.R. Stilwell first in 1938 and with better accuracy in 1941. It was designed to test the 【118†transverse Doppler effect】\u00a0– the 【119†redshift】 of light from a moving source in a direction perpendicular to its velocity—which had been predicted by Einstein in 1905. The strategy was to compare observed Doppler shifts with what was predicted by classical theory, and look for a 【120†Lorentz factor】 correction. Such a correction was observed, from which was concluded that the frequency of a moving atomic clock is altered according to special relativity.\\n\\n\\\\[ _【121†citation needed】_\\\\]\\n\\nThose classic experiments have been repeated many times with increased precision. Other experiments include, for instance, 【122†relativistic energy and momentum increase】 at high velocities, 【123†experimental testing of time dilation】, and 【124†modern searches for Lorentz violations】.\\n\\n### Tests of general relativity\\n\\nGeneral relativity has also been confirmed many times, the classic experiments being the perihelion precession of 【87†Mercury】's orbit, the 【125†deflection of light】 by the 【126†Sun】, and the 【127†gravitational redshift】 of light. Other tests confirmed the 【75†equivalence principle】 and 【128†frame dragging】.\\n\\n## Modern applications\\n\\n 【129†\\\\[24\\\\]】【130†\\\\[25\\\\]】【131†\\\\[26\\\\]】\\n\\nFar from being simply of theoretical interest, relativistic effects are important practical engineering concerns. Satellite-based measurement needs to take into account relativistic effects, as each satellite is in motion relative to an Earth-bound user, and is thus in a different frame of reference under the theory of relativity. Global positioning systems such as 【132†GPS】, 【133†GLONASS】, and 【134†Galileo】, must account for all of the relativistic effects in order to work with precision, such as the consequences of the Earth's gravitational field. This is also the case in the high-precision measurement of time. Instruments ranging from electron microscopes to particle accelerators would not work if relativistic considerations were omitted.\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n- 【135†Doubly special relativity】\\n- 【136†Galilean invariance】\\n- 【137†List of textbooks on relativity】\\n\\n## References\\n\\n01. **【138†^】** Einstein A.

According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. [...] a while, Einstein thought that there were problems with the approach, but he later returned to it and, by late 1915, had published his general theory of relativity in the form in which it is used today. This theory explains gravitation as the distortion of the structure of spacetime by matter, affecting the inertial motion of other matter. [...] As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was the preference of inertial motion within special relativity, while a theory which from the outset prefers no particular state of motion appeared more satisfactory to him.

Electrodynamics actually needed no adjustment. Einstein's 1905 theory of relativity had been created to fit with the existing theory. The mechanics of bodies required adjustments to the notions of energy, momentum and mass. The most prominent of these was the famous equivalence E=mc2. Einstein also sketched a relativistic treatment of thermodynamics, the theory of heat and work. [...] Fortunately for Einstein, no measurement was taken. Einstein's theory of 1914 was not yet the complete general theory of relativity. In his earlier theory, there was no curvature of ordinary space in the vicinity of the sun. As a result, as we saw in another chapter, his theory predicted the same deflection as Newtonian gravitation theory (assuming light consists of massive corpuscles). It was half the deflection predicted by the final theory.

It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper \\\"【57†On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies】\\\" (for the contributions of many other physicists and mathematicians, see 【58†History of special relativity】). Special relativity is based on two postulates which are contradictory in 【15†classical mechanics】:\\n\\n1. The 【59†laws of physics】 are the same for all observers in any 【60†inertial frame of reference】 relative to one another (【46†principle of relativity】).\\n2. The 【61†speed of light】 in 【62†vacuum】 is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or of the motion of the 【63†light】 source.\\n\\nThe resultant theory copes with experiment better than classical mechanics. For instance, postulate 2 explains the results of the 【64†Michelson–Morley experiment】. Moreover, the theory has many surprising and counterintuitive consequences. Some of these are:\\n\\n- 【20†Relativity of simultaneity】: Two events, simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another observer if the observers are in relative motion.\\n- 【22†Time dilation】: Moving 【65†clocks】 are measured to tick more slowly than an observer's \\\"stationary\\\" clock.\\n- 【23†Length contraction】: Objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.\\n- 【66†Maximum speed is finite】: No physical object, message or field line can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum.\\n  - The effect of gravity can only travel through space at the speed of light, not faster or instantaneously.\\n- 【67†Mass–energy equivalence】: 2 _E_ = _mc_, energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable.\\n 【68†\\\\[9\\\\]】- 【69†Relativistic mass】, idea used by some researchers.\\n\\nThe defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the 【70†Galilean transformations】 of classical mechanics by the 【71†Lorentz transformations】. (See 【72†Maxwell's equations】 of 【73†electromagnetism】.)\\n\\n## General relativity\\n\\n 【74†\\\\[10\\\\]】\\n\\nGeneral relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the 【75†equivalence principle】, under which the states of 【76†accelerated motion】 and being at rest in a 【9†gravitational field】 (for example, when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that 【77†free fall】 is 【78†inertial motion】: an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no 【79†force】 being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of 【9†gravity】 as is the case in 【15†classical mechanics】. This is incompatible with classical mechanics and 【7†special relativity】 because in those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to each other, but objects in free fall do so. To resolve this difficulty Einstein first proposed that 【80†spacetime is curved】. Einstein discussed his idea with mathematician 【81†Marcel Grossmann】 and they concluded that general relativity could be formulated in the context of 【82†Riemannian geometry】 which had been developed in the 1800s. In 1915, he devised the 【83†Einstein field equations】 which relate the curvature of spacetime with the mass, energy, and any momentum within it.\\n\\nSome of the consequences of general relativity are:\\n\\n【84†\\\\[11\\\\]】- 【85†Gravitational time dilation】: Clocks run slower in deeper gravitational wells.\\n- 【86†Precession】: Orbits precess in a way unexpected in Newton's theory of gravity. (This has been observed in the orbit of 【87†Mercury】 and in 【88†binary pulsars】).\\n- 【89†Light deflection】: Rays of 【63†light】 bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\\n- 【90†Frame-dragging】: Rotating masses \\\"drag along\\\" the 【1†spacetime】 around them.\\n- 【91†Expansion of the universe】: The universe is expanding, and certain components within the universe can 【92†accelerate the expansion】.\\n\\nTechnically, general relativity is a theory of 【93†gravitation】 whose defining feature is its use of the 【83†Einstein field equations】. The solutions of the field equations are 【94†metric tensors】 which define the 【95†topology】 of the spacetime and how objects move inertially.\\n\\n## Experimental evidence\\n\\n 【3†\\\\[2\\\\]】\\n\\nEinstein explained that the theory of relativity falls under a category of scientific frameworks known as \\\"principle-theories\\\"—theories that start not from speculative constructs or imagined mechanisms, but from well-established empirical facts and observed regularities in nature. Unlike constructive theories, which attempt to build models of phenomena from assumed underlying processes, principle-theories, such as relativity, adopt an analytic approach: they begin with experimentally verified principles and work deductively to uncover the logical consequences and constraints that any physical process must obey. By observing natural processes, we understand their general characteristics, devise mathematical models to describe what we observed, and by analytical means we deduce the necessary conditions that have to be satisfied. Measurement of separate events must satisfy these conditions and match the theory's conclusions.\\n\\n### Tests of special relativity\\n\\nA diagram of the 【64†Michelson–Morley experiment】 【96†\\\\[12\\\\]】\\n\\nRelativity is a 【97†falsifiable】 theory: It makes predictions that can be tested by experiment. In the case of special relativity, these include the principle of relativity, the constancy of the speed of light, and time dilation. The predictions of special relativity have been confirmed in numerous tests since Einstein published his paper in 1905, but three experiments conducted between 1881 and 1938 were critical to its validation. These are the 【64†Michelson–Morley experiment】, the 【98†Kennedy–Thorndike experiment】, and the 【99†Ives–Stilwell experiment】. Einstein derived the 【71†Lorentz transformations】 from first principles in 1905, but these three experiments allow the transformations to be induced from experimental evidence.\\n\\n22【100†\\\\[13\\\\]】【101†\\\\[14\\\\]】\\n\\n【72†Maxwell's equations】—the foundation of classical electromagnetism—describe light as a wave that moves with a characteristic velocity. The modern view is that light needs no medium of transmission, but Maxwell and his contemporaries were convinced that light waves were propagated in a medium, analogous to sound propagating in air, and ripples propagating on the surface of a pond. This hypothetical medium was called the 【102†luminiferous aether】, at rest relative to the \\\"fixed stars\\\" and through which the Earth moves. Fresnel's 【103†partial ether dragging hypothesis】 ruled out the measurement of first-order (v/c) effects, and although observations of second-order effects (v/c) were possible in principle, Maxwell thought they were too small to be detected with then-current technology.\\n\\n【104†\\\\[15\\\\]】【105†\\\\[16\\\\]】【101†\\\\[14\\\\]】【106†\\\\[17\\\\]】【107†\\\\[18\\\\]】【108†\\\\[19\\\\]】\\n\\nThe Michelson–Morley experiment was designed to detect second-order effects of the \\\"aether wind\\\"—the motion of the aether relative to the Earth. Michelson designed an instrument called the 【109†Michelson interferometer】 to accomplish this. The apparatus was sufficiently accurate to detect the expected effects, but he obtained a null result when the first experiment was conducted in 1881, and again in 1887. Although the failure to detect an aether wind was a disappointment, the results were accepted by the scientific community. In an attempt to salvage the aether paradigm, FitzGerald and Lorentz independently created an 【110†ad hoc hypothesis】 in which the length of material bodies changes according to their motion through the aether. This was the origin of 【111†FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction】, and their hypothesis had no theoretical basis. The interpretation of the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment is that the round-trip travel time for light is 【112†isotropic】 (independent of direction), but the result alone is not enough to discount the theory of the aether or validate the predictions of special relativity.\\n\\nThe 【98†Kennedy–Thorndike experiment】 shown with interference fringes 【113†\\\\[20\\\\]】【108†\\\\[19\\\\]】【114†\\\\[21\\\\]】【107†\\\\[18\\\\]】【108†\\\\[19\\\\]】\\n\\nWhile the Michelson–Morley experiment showed that the velocity of light is isotropic, it said nothing about how the magnitude of the velocity changed (if at all) in different 【115†inertial frames】. The Kennedy–Thorndike experiment was designed to do that, and was first performed in 1932 by Roy Kennedy and Edward Thorndike. They obtained a null result, and concluded that \\\"there is no effect ... unless the velocity of the solar system in space is no more than about half that of the earth in its orbit\\\". That possibility was thought to be too coincidental to provide an acceptable explanation, so from the null result of their experiment it was concluded that the round-trip time for light is the same in all inertial reference frames.\\n\\n【116†\\\\[22\\\\]】【117†\\\\[23\\\\]】【107†\\\\[18\\\\]】【108†\\\\[19\\\\]】\\n\\nThe Ives–Stilwell experiment was carried out by Herbert Ives and G.R. Stilwell first in 1938 and with better accuracy in 1941. It was designed to test the 【118†transverse Doppler effect】\u00a0– the 【119†redshift】 of light from a moving source in a direction perpendicular to its velocity—which had been predicted by Einstein in 1905. The strategy was to compare observed Doppler shifts with what was predicted by classical theory, and look for a 【120†Lorentz factor】 correction. Such a correction was observed, from which was concluded that the frequency of a moving atomic clock is altered according to special relativity.\\n\\n\\\\[ _【121†citation needed】_\\\\]\\n\\nThose classic experiments have been repeated many times with increased precision. Other experiments include, for instance, 【122†relativistic energy and momentum increase】 at high velocities, 【123†experimental testing of time dilation】, and 【124†modern searches for Lorentz violations】.\\n\\n### Tests of general relativity\\n\\nGeneral relativity has also been confirmed many times, the classic experiments being the perihelion precession of 【87†Mercury】's orbit, the 【125†deflection of light】 by the 【126†Sun】, and the 【127†gravitational redshift】 of light. Other tests confirmed the 【75†equivalence principle】 and 【128†frame dragging】.\\n\\n## Modern applications\\n\\n 【129†\\\\[24\\\\]】【130†\\\\[25\\\\]】【131†\\\\[26\\\\]】\\n\\nFar from being simply of theoretical interest, relativistic effects are important practical engineering concerns. Satellite-based measurement needs to take into account relativistic effects, as each satellite is in motion relative to an Earth-bound user, and is thus in a different frame of reference under the theory of relativity. Global positioning systems such as 【132†GPS】, 【133†GLONASS】, and 【134†Galileo】, must account for all of the relativistic effects in order to work with precision, such as the consequences of the Earth's gravitational field. This is also the case in the high-precision measurement of time. Instruments ranging from electron microscopes to particle accelerators would not work if relativistic considerations were omitted.\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n- 【135†Doubly special relativity】\\n- 【136†Galilean invariance】\\n- 【137†List of textbooks on relativity】\\n\\n## References\\n\\n01. **【138†^】** Einstein A.
