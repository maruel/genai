The schema provided is {\"is_fruit\": bool}. So I need to output a JSON object with a boolean value.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm whether a banana is classified as a fruit. From a botanical standpoint, a banana is a fruit because it develops from the flowering plant and contains seeds. However, sometimes people might categorize it differently based on common usage, but the question is straightforward. Since the user is asking directly, the answer should be true. But wait, in some contexts, like culinary terms, bananas are considered fruits. So the answer is definitely true. I should set \"is_fruit\": true. Make sure the JSON is correctly formatted with curly braces and proper syntax. No need to add anything else since the user specified not to include explanations. Just the boolean. Alright, that's all.\n"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.006713067,"prompt_tokens":58,"prompt_time":0.002053146,"completion_tokens":197,"completion_time":0.498639876,"total_tokens":255,"total_time":0.500693022},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_80fea1a458","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k0pqd5fmfg4s0vr2ymjjzz86"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
