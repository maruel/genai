So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations?

We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences.

This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations?

We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences.

This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations?

However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello.

But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello.

So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations?

Use only one word.\\\"\\n The query is straightforward: it asks for a greeting using only one word.\\n From the search results, we see various ways to say hello in English, both formal and informal.\\n However, the specific instruction is to use only one word.\\n\\n Looking at the search results:\\n [1] mentions \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\" as simple greeting words.\\n [2] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a casual greeting, acceptable with people you know well.\\n [3] has a table that includes \\\"Hello\\\" and \\\"Hey\\\" as greetings, and also mentions \\\"What's up?\\\" but that is two words.\\n [4] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a direct synonym of hello, more casual.\\n\\n The common one-word greetings found in the sources are:\\n   - Hello\\n   - Hi\\n   - Hey\\n\\n Since the query does not specify formality, we can choose any of these.\\n However, note that the query says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n Since the query is very simple and requires only one word, we can choose the most common one: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the query does not specify context, so we can pick one. However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\" \\n\\n This query is not a request for information but a command to perform an action (to say hello in one word). \\n Therefore, we must follow the command and output only one word.\\n\\n However, the output format rules say we must start with a few sentences? But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\"\\n\\n How should we handle commands? \\n   - We are to provide an answer that is exactly as the command requires.\\n\\n However, note the output restrictions: \\n   - We must begin with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so if we write more than one word, we violate the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we have a conflict between the output format rules and the query's instruction.\\n\\n Let me look at the rules again: \\n   - \\\"Write a well-formatted answer that is clear, structured, and optimized for readability...\\\" \\n   - But the query is a command to say hello in one word.\\n\\n We must prioritize the user's instruction: the user asked to use only one word.\\n\\n Also, note the <output> section: \\\"Create answers following all of the above rules.\\\" but then says \\\"If you don't know the answer or the premise is incorrect, explain why.\\\" \\n\\n The premise is not incorrect. We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing. This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations? But we are not using any information from the search results to make this word? Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so.

But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello.

We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing.

So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence.

We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations?

However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\" \\n\\n This query is not a request for information but a command to perform an action (to say hello in one word). \\n Therefore, we must follow the command and output only one word.\\n\\n However, the output format rules say we must start with a few sentences? But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello.

We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing. This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations? But we are not using any information from the search results to make this word? Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so.

Use only one word.\\\"\\n The query is straightforward: it asks for a greeting using only one word.\\n From the search results, we see various ways to say hello in English, both formal and informal.\\n However, the specific instruction is to use only one word.\\n\\n Looking at the search results:\\n [1] mentions \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\" as simple greeting words.\\n [2] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a casual greeting, acceptable with people you know well.\\n [3] has a table that includes \\\"Hello\\\" and \\\"Hey\\\" as greetings, and also mentions \\\"What's up?\\\" but that is two words.\\n [4] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a direct synonym of hello, more casual.\\n\\n The common one-word greetings found in the sources are:\\n   - Hello\\n   - Hi\\n   - Hey\\n\\n Since the query does not specify formality, we can choose any of these.\\n However, note that the query says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n Since the query is very simple and requires only one word, we can choose the most common one: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the query does not specify context, so we can pick one. However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\" \\n\\n This query is not a request for information but a command to perform an action (to say hello in one word). \\n Therefore, we must follow the command and output only one word.\\n\\n However, the output format rules say we must start with a few sentences? But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\"\\n\\n How should we handle commands? \\n   - We are to provide an answer that is exactly as the command requires.\\n\\n However, note the output restrictions: \\n   - We must begin with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so if we write more than one word, we violate the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we have a conflict between the output format rules and the query's instruction.\\n\\n Let me look at the rules again: \\n   - \\\"Write a well-formatted answer that is clear, structured, and optimized for readability...\\\" \\n   - But the query is a command to say hello in one word.\\n\\n We must prioritize the user's instruction: the user asked to use only one word.\\n\\n Also, note the <output> section: \\\"Create answers following all of the above rules.\\\" but then says \\\"If you don't know the answer or the premise is incorrect, explain why.\\\" \\n\\n The premise is not incorrect. We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing. This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations? But we are not using any information from the search results to make this word? Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so. The search results only inform us that \\\"Hello\\\" is acceptable, but we are not paraphrasing or quoting.\\n\\n Therefore, we will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n But wait: the output format rules also say: \\\"Wrap up the answer with a few sentences that are a general summary.\\\" - This would break the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n Alternatively, we can interpret the command as the entire answer, so the answer is just the one word. \\n\\n Considering all, I think the best course is to output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to fulfill the command.\\n\\n However, note that the instructions also say: \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\".

However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\" \\n\\n This query is not a request for information but a command to perform an action (to say hello in one word). \\n Therefore, we must follow the command and output only one word.\\n\\n However, the output format rules say we must start with a few sentences? But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\"\\n\\n How should we handle commands? \\n   - We are to provide an answer that is exactly as the command requires.\\n\\n However, note the output restrictions: \\n   - We must begin with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so if we write more than one word, we violate the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we have a conflict between the output format rules and the query's instruction.\\n\\n Let me look at the rules again: \\n   - \\\"Write a well-formatted answer that is clear, structured, and optimized for readability...\\\" \\n   - But the query is a command to say hello in one word.\\n\\n We must prioritize the user's instruction: the user asked to use only one word.\\n\\n Also, note the <output> section: \\\"Create answers following all of the above rules.\\\" but then says \\\"If you don't know the answer or the premise is incorrect, explain why.\\\" \\n\\n The premise is not incorrect. We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing. This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations? But we are not using any information from the search results to make this word? Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so.

However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\" \\n\\n This query is not a request for information but a command to perform an action (to say hello in one word). \\n Therefore, we must follow the command and output only one word.\\n\\n However, the output format rules say we must start with a few sentences? But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello.

We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing. This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations? But we are not using any information from the search results to make this word? Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so.

Use only one word.\\\"\\n The query is straightforward: it asks for a greeting using only one word.\\n From the search results, we see various ways to say hello in English, both formal and informal.\\n However, the specific instruction is to use only one word.\\n\\n Looking at the search results:\\n [1] mentions \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\" as simple greeting words.\\n [2] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a casual greeting, acceptable with people you know well.\\n [3] has a table that includes \\\"Hello\\\" and \\\"Hey\\\" as greetings, and also mentions \\\"What's up?\\\" but that is two words.\\n [4] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a direct synonym of hello, more casual.\\n\\n The common one-word greetings found in the sources are:\\n   - Hello\\n   - Hi\\n   - Hey\\n\\n Since the query does not specify formality, we can choose any of these.\\n However, note that the query says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n Since the query is very simple and requires only one word, we can choose the most common one: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the query does not specify context, so we can pick one. However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\" \\n\\n This query is not a request for information but a command to perform an action (to say hello in one word). \\n Therefore, we must follow the command and output only one word.\\n\\n However, the output format rules say we must start with a few sentences? But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\"\\n\\n How should we handle commands? \\n   - We are to provide an answer that is exactly as the command requires.\\n\\n However, note the output restrictions: \\n   - We must begin with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so if we write more than one word, we violate the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we have a conflict between the output format rules and the query's instruction.\\n\\n Let me look at the rules again: \\n   - \\\"Write a well-formatted answer that is clear, structured, and optimized for readability...\\\" \\n   - But the query is a command to say hello in one word.\\n\\n We must prioritize the user's instruction: the user asked to use only one word.\\n\\n Also, note the <output> section: \\\"Create answers following all of the above rules.\\\" but then says \\\"If you don't know the answer or the premise is incorrect, explain why.\\\" \\n\\n The premise is not incorrect. We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing. This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations? But we are not using any information from the search results to make this word? Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so. The search results only inform us that \\\"Hello\\\" is acceptable, but we are not paraphrasing or quoting.\\n\\n Therefore, we will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n But wait: the output format rules also say: \\\"Wrap up the answer with a few sentences that are a general summary.\\\" - This would break the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n Alternatively, we can interpret the command as the entire answer, so the answer is just the one word. \\n\\n Considering all, I think the best course is to output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to fulfill the command.\\n\\n However, note that the instructions also say: \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\".

Use only one word.\\\"\\n The query is straightforward: it asks for a greeting using only one word.\\n From the search results, we see various ways to say hello in English, both formal and informal.\\n However, the specific instruction is to use only one word.\\n\\n Looking at the search results:\\n [1] mentions \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\" as simple greeting words.\\n [2] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a casual greeting, acceptable with people you know well.\\n [3] has a table that includes \\\"Hello\\\" and \\\"Hey\\\" as greetings, and also mentions \\\"What's up?\\\" but that is two words.\\n [4] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a direct synonym of hello, more casual.\\n\\n The common one-word greetings found in the sources are:\\n   - Hello\\n   - Hi\\n   - Hey\\n\\n Since the query does not specify formality, we can choose any of these.\\n However, note that the query says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n Since the query is very simple and requires only one word, we can choose the most common one: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the query does not specify context, so we can pick one. However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\" \\n\\n This query is not a request for information but a command to perform an action (to say hello in one word). \\n Therefore, we must follow the command and output only one word.\\n\\n However, the output format rules say we must start with a few sentences? But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\"\\n\\n How should we handle commands? \\n   - We are to provide an answer that is exactly as the command requires.\\n\\n However, note the output restrictions: \\n   - We must begin with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so if we write more than one word, we violate the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we have a conflict between the output format rules and the query's instruction.\\n\\n Let me look at the rules again: \\n   - \\\"Write a well-formatted answer that is clear, structured, and optimized for readability...\\\" \\n   - But the query is a command to say hello in one word.\\n\\n We must prioritize the user's instruction: the user asked to use only one word.\\n\\n Also, note the <output> section: \\\"Create answers following all of the above rules.\\\" but then says \\\"If you don't know the answer or the premise is incorrect, explain why.\\\" \\n\\n The premise is not incorrect. We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing. This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations? But we are not using any information from the search results to make this word? Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so. The search results only inform us that \\\"Hello\\\" is acceptable, but we are not paraphrasing or quoting.\\n\\n Therefore, we will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n But wait: the output format rules also say: \\\"Wrap up the answer with a few sentences that are a general summary.\\\" - This would break the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n Alternatively, we can interpret the command as the entire answer, so the answer is just the one word. \\n\\n Considering all, I think the best course is to output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to fulfill the command.\\n\\n However, note that the instructions also say: \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\".

However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello.

But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello.

We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing.

So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations?

Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so.

But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello.

So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations?

Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so.

However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\" \\n\\n This query is not a request for information but a command to perform an action (to say hello in one word). \\n Therefore, we must follow the command and output only one word.\\n\\n However, the output format rules say we must start with a few sentences? But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello.

We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing. This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations? But we are not using any information from the search results to make this word? Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so.

However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\" \\n\\n This query is not a request for information but a command to perform an action (to say hello in one word). \\n Therefore, we must follow the command and output only one word.\\n\\n However, the output format rules say we must start with a few sentences? But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello.

We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing. This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations? But we are not using any information from the search results to make this word? Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so.

Use only one word.\\\"\\n The query is straightforward: it asks for a greeting using only one word.\\n From the search results, we see various ways to say hello in English, both formal and informal.\\n However, the specific instruction is to use only one word.\\n\\n Looking at the search results:\\n [1] mentions \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\" as simple greeting words.\\n [2] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a casual greeting, acceptable with people you know well.\\n [3] has a table that includes \\\"Hello\\\" and \\\"Hey\\\" as greetings, and also mentions \\\"What's up?\\\" but that is two words.\\n [4] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a direct synonym of hello, more casual.\\n\\n The common one-word greetings found in the sources are:\\n   - Hello\\n   - Hi\\n   - Hey\\n\\n Since the query does not specify formality, we can choose any of these.\\n However, note that the query says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n Since the query is very simple and requires only one word, we can choose the most common one: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the query does not specify context, so we can pick one. However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\" \\n\\n This query is not a request for information but a command to perform an action (to say hello in one word). \\n Therefore, we must follow the command and output only one word.\\n\\n However, the output format rules say we must start with a few sentences? But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\"\\n\\n How should we handle commands? \\n   - We are to provide an answer that is exactly as the command requires.\\n\\n However, note the output restrictions: \\n   - We must begin with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so if we write more than one word, we violate the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we have a conflict between the output format rules and the query's instruction.\\n\\n Let me look at the rules again: \\n   - \\\"Write a well-formatted answer that is clear, structured, and optimized for readability...\\\" \\n   - But the query is a command to say hello in one word.\\n\\n We must prioritize the user's instruction: the user asked to use only one word.\\n\\n Also, note the <output> section: \\\"Create answers following all of the above rules.\\\" but then says \\\"If you don't know the answer or the premise is incorrect, explain why.\\\" \\n\\n The premise is not incorrect. We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing. This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations? But we are not using any information from the search results to make this word? Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so.

Use only one word.\\\"\\n The query is straightforward: it asks for a greeting using only one word.\\n From the search results, we see various ways to say hello in English, both formal and informal.\\n However, the specific instruction is to use only one word.\\n\\n Looking at the search results:\\n [1] mentions \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\" as simple greeting words.\\n [2] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a casual greeting, acceptable with people you know well.\\n [3] has a table that includes \\\"Hello\\\" and \\\"Hey\\\" as greetings, and also mentions \\\"What's up?\\\" but that is two words.\\n [4] lists \\\"Hey\\\" as a direct synonym of hello, more casual.\\n\\n The common one-word greetings found in the sources are:\\n   - Hello\\n   - Hi\\n   - Hey\\n\\n Since the query does not specify formality, we can choose any of these.\\n However, note that the query says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n Since the query is very simple and requires only one word, we can choose the most common one: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the query does not specify context, so we can pick one. However, the sources show that all of these are acceptable.\\n\\n However, the instruction is to use only one word, so we must not write anything else. But note the output format rules: \\n   - We must start with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\" \\n\\n This query is not a request for information but a command to perform an action (to say hello in one word). \\n Therefore, we must follow the command and output only one word.\\n\\n However, the output format rules say we must start with a few sentences? But note the restrictions: never start with a header, but we are allowed to start with a few sentences.\\n\\n But in this case, the query is a command. We must consider the query type: it doesn't fit the typical types (academic, news, weather, etc.). \\n\\n Let me reconsider the output rules: \\n   - The goal is to write a comprehensive answer to the Query, drawing from the given search results.\\n   - But the Query is a command: \\\"Say hello. Use only one word.\\\"\\n\\n How should we handle commands? \\n   - We are to provide an answer that is exactly as the command requires.\\n\\n However, note the output restrictions: \\n   - We must begin with a few sentences that provide a summary of the overall answer? \\n   - But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so if we write more than one word, we violate the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we have a conflict between the output format rules and the query's instruction.\\n\\n Let me look at the rules again: \\n   - \\\"Write a well-formatted answer that is clear, structured, and optimized for readability...\\\" \\n   - But the query is a command to say hello in one word.\\n\\n We must prioritize the user's instruction: the user asked to use only one word.\\n\\n Also, note the <output> section: \\\"Create answers following all of the above rules.\\\" but then says \\\"If you don't know the answer or the premise is incorrect, explain why.\\\" \\n\\n The premise is not incorrect. We can say hello in one word.\\n\\n So, to resolve:\\n   - We must output only one word to comply with the command.\\n   - But the format rules say to start with a few sentences. This would break the command.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n However, note the <query_type> section doesn't cover this, but it does say for \\\"Creative Writing\\\": \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". \\n\\n But this isn't creative writing, it's a command. \\n\\n Alternatively, consider the \\\"Translation\\\" type: if a user asks to translate, we just provide the translation without citing. This is similar: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we must do it without extra text.\\n\\n Therefore, I will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to comply with the command.\\n\\n But wait: the user said \\\"Use only one word\\\". So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n However, note that the search results show multiple one-word options: Hello, Hi, Hey.\\n\\n Which one to choose? \\n   - The query doesn't specify, so we can pick the most standard: \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n Alternatively, note that the query says \\\"Say hello\\\", which literally means to say the word \\\"hello\\\". So we should say \\\"hello\\\".\\n\\n But note: the word \\\"hello\\\" is written in lowercase in the query. However, in English, it is standard to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. But we are not writing a sentence? We are writing one word.\\n\\n Since we are writing one word and not a complete sentence, we can write it as a standalone word: \\\"Hello\\\" (with capital H) is the standard spelling when used alone.\\n\\n Alternatively, we could write it exactly as the query: \\\"hello\\\" (lowercase). \\n\\n But note: the sources, when listing the words, typically capitalize the first letter when they are used as examples (e.g., [2] says \\\"Hey\\\", [1] says \\\"Hi\\\", \\\"Hey\\\", \\\"Hello\\\").\\n\\n So we will output: \\\"Hello\\\"\\n\\n However, the output format rules also require citations? But we are not using any information from the search results to make this word? Actually, we are: we are confirming that \\\"Hello\\\" is a valid one-word greeting.\\n\\n But the command says \\\"Use only one word\\\", so we must not include citations? \\n\\n How can we cite? We cannot put a citation without violating the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must not include citations. \\n\\n The query_type section for Translation says: \\\"If a user asks you to translate something, you must not cite any search results and should just provide the translation.\\\" \\n\\n We can treat this similarly: we are being asked to perform an action (to say hello) and we are doing so. The search results only inform us that \\\"Hello\\\" is acceptable, but we are not paraphrasing or quoting.\\n\\n Therefore, we will output only the word \\\"Hello\\\".\\n\\n But wait: the output format rules also say: \\\"Wrap up the answer with a few sentences that are a general summary.\\\" - This would break the one-word rule.\\n\\n Therefore, we must break the format rules for this specific command? \\n\\n Alternatively, we can interpret the command as the entire answer, so the answer is just the one word. \\n\\n Considering all, I think the best course is to output only the word \\\"Hello\\\" to fulfill the command.\\n\\n However, note that the instructions also say: \\\"If the Query requires creative writing, you DO NOT need to use or cite search results\\\". This command is similar: we are creating the greeting.\\n\\n So we will output:\\n\\n Hello\\n\\n But note: the system says to write an answer that is self-contained. We are doing that by directly answering the command.\\n\\n Alternatively, if we are to follow the format rules strictly, we might write:\\n\\n   There are many ways to say hello in English, but for a one-word greeting, the most common is:\\n\\n   Hello\\n\\n However, that is two lines and more than one word.\\n\\n The user said: \\\"Use only one word.\\\" So we must output exactly one word.\\n\\n Therefore, we will output only:\\n\\n Hello\\n\\n But note: the output must be in the format of a message?
