Let me check the available functions. The tool has a function called best_country that takes a country parameter, which can be either Canada or USA. Since the user mentioned both countries, I need to call the function for each to compare. But wait, the function's parameters only allow one country at a time. So I should make two separate calls: one for Canada and one for the USA. Then, compare the results to see which one is rated higher. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly. First, call best_country with Canada, then with USA. Once I have both responses, I can present the comparison to the user.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"nkfb2m223","type":"function","function":{"name":"best_country","arguments":"{\"country\":\"Canada\"}"}},{"id":"8jxnqtert","type":"function","function":{"name":"best_country","arguments":"{\"country\":\"USA\"}"}}]},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.007787978000000001,"prompt_tokens":211,"prompt_time":0.008161511,"completion_tokens":200,"completion_time":0.357011871,"total_tokens":411,"total_time":0.365173382},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_80fea1a458","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k0fjn2greqk9dmy3f8fxg8kf"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
