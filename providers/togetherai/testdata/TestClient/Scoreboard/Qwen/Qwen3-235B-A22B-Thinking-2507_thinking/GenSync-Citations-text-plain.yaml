The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. What is the capital of Quackiland?\\\"\\n\\nIt seems straightforward. It says the capital of Quackiland is Quack. So, the capital should be Quack.\\n\\nBut then it mentions \\\"The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack.\\\" I wonder if this is a trick or if there's something I'm missing. \\\"Canard\\\" might be a play on words because \\\"canard\\\" means \\\"duck\\\" in French, and \\\"Quack\\\" sounds like a duck sound. So Quackiland might be a fictional place with a duck theme.\\n\\nThe question is asking for the capital of Quackiland, and it directly states that it is Quack. The part about the Big Canard Statue seems irrelevant to the question. It might be there to distract or to add context, but it doesn't change the fact that the capital is given as Quack.\\n\\nLet me read the question again: \\\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack. The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. What is the capital of Quackiland?\\\"\\n\\nIt's almost like a riddle. Sometimes in riddles, there might be a pun or a double meaning. \\\"Quack\\\" can mean a fake doctor or something, but here it's used as a place name.\\n\\n\\\"Canard\\\" in French means duck, and \\\"Big Canard\\\" might mean \\\"Big Duck,\\\" so the Big Duck Statue is in Quack. But again, that doesn't affect the capital.\\n\\nPerhaps there's a wordplay with \\\"capital.\\\" Capital can mean the city that is the seat of government, or it can mean uppercase letter. But in this context, it's clearly about the city.\\n\\nMaybe \\\"Quack\\\" is not the name but a description. But the sentence says \\\"the capital of Quackiland is Quack,\\\" so Quack is the name of the capital city.\\n\\nLet me consider if \\\"Quack\\\" could be misinterpreted. For example, if someone says \\\"quack,\\\" it might not be a proper noun, but here it's capitalized: \\\"Quack.\\\" In the text, it says \\\"Quack\\\" with a capital Q, so it's likely a proper noun.\\n\\nIn the user's message: \\\"the capital of Quackiland is Quack.\\\" Quackiland is capitalized, and Quack is capitalized, so they are proper nouns.\\n\\nSimilarly, \\\"Big Canard Statue\\\" is capitalized.\\n\\nSo, I think it's straightforward. The capital is Quack.\\n\\nBut why mention the statue? Maybe to confuse or to provide extra information that isn't needed.\\n\\nPerhaps in some contexts, \\\"canard\\\" has another meaning. In English, \\\"canard\\\" can mean a false story or rumor, like an urban legend. But here it's \\\"Big Canard Statue,\\\" so it's probably referring to a duck statue.\\n\\nGiven that, it still doesn't change the capital.\\n\\nMaybe the question is testing if I get distracted by irrelevant information.\\n\\nThe question is: \\\"What is the capital of Quackiland?\\\"\\n\\nBased on the first sentence, it's Quack.\\n\\nPerhaps there's a trick with the word \\\"located.\\\" But it says the statue is in Quack, which is the capital, so it's consistent.\\n\\nAnother thought: maybe \\\"Quack\\\" is not the city name but something else. But the sentence structure is clear: \\\"the capital of Quackiland is Quack.\\\" So Quack is the name.\\n\\nFor example, \\\"the capital of France is Paris\\\" – Paris is the name.\\n\\nSimilarly here.\\n\\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. The answer should be Quack.\\n\\nBut let me see if there's any cultural reference or joke I'm missing.\\n\\nQuackiland sounds like it's related to ducks, since \\\"quack\\\" is a duck sound. And \\\"canard\\\" is French for duck, so Big Canard means Big Duck.\\n\\nBut again, irrelevant.\\n\\nPerhaps the capital is not Quack because of the statue, but that doesn't make sense.\\n\\nMaybe \\\"Quack\\\" is a homophone for \\\"quack\\\" as in fake, but in context, it's a place.\\n\\nI think I should just go with the given information.\\n\\nSo, the capital of Quackiland is Quack.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is Quack.\\n\\nThe question says \\\"What is the capital of Quackiland?\\\" and based on the premise, it's Quack.\\n\\nPerhaps the Big Canard Statue is a clue that it's in Quack, but since Quack is the capital, it's fine.\\n\\nI think I'm done.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of Quackiland is explicitly stated as **Quack** in the given information. The mention of the Big Canard Statue being located in Quack is additional context but does not change the fact that Quack is the capital. Therefore, the capital of Quackiland is **Quack**.\\n\\nThis is a straightforward question based on the provided details, and the reference to the Big Canard Statue (which plays on the French word \\\"canard,\\\" meaning \\\"duck,\\\" and aligns with the duck-themed pun in \\\"Quackiland\\\" and \\\"Quack\\\") serves as irrelevant or decorative information for the specific query about the capital.\",\n        \"tool_calls\": [],\n        \"reasoning\": null\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\",\n      \"seed\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 40,\n    \"total_tokens\": 1131,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 1091\n  }\n}"
