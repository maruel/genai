The user is asking if a banana is a fruit. They want a JSON response with just a boolean. First, I need to confirm the answer. A banana is botanically a fruit because it develops from the flowering part of the plant and contains seeds. Even though in some culinary contexts it's used as a vegetable, scientifically it's a fruit. The user specified not to include an explanation, so I just need to set \"is_fruit\" to true. Let me make sure the JSON is formatted correctly without any extra text.\n"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.006264022999999999,"prompt_tokens":58,"prompt_time":0.008824335,"completion_tokens":127,"completion_time":0.273396455,"total_tokens":185,"total_time":0.28222079},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_78ac7f3229","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k0qphc1bee9sb5rxps7h9gab"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
