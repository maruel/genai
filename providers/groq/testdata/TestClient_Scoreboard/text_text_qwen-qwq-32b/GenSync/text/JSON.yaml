Let me think about this. Biologically, a fruit is the mature ovary of a plant, usually containing seeds. Bananas develop from the flower and have seeds, although the ones we eat are sterile and the seeds are tiny. So technically, yes, a banana is a fruit. But sometimes people might think of it as a vegetable in culinary terms. However, the question is straightforward. The user wants a JSON response with just \"is_fruit\" as a boolean. I need to make sure I don't include any explanation, just true or false. The correct answer here is true because botanically, it's a fruit. So the JSON should be {\"is_fruit\": true}.\n"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.108953364,"prompt_tokens":48,"prompt_time":0.005526778,"completion_tokens":164,"completion_time":0.40740091,"total_tokens":212,"total_time":0.412927688},"usage_breakdown":{"models":null},"system_fingerprint":"fp_1e88ca32eb","x_groq":{"id":"req_01jwksntd0f5kbr5g7qc0wf2a6"}}
