The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. What is the capital of Quackiland?\"\n\nThe key information here is that the capital of Quackiland is explicitly stated as Quack. That''s given in the first sentence.\n\nThe second sentence says that the Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. But that doesn''t change the capital; it''s just additional information about Quack.\n\nSo, when asked for the capital of Quackiland, it should be straightforward: Quack.\n\nBut let me make sure there''s no trick here. Is Quackiland a real place? I don''t think so; it sounds fictional, like a play on words. \"Quack\" might refer to the sound a duck makes, and \"canard\" is French for duck, so this is probably a humorous or fictional scenario.\n\nThe question seems to be testing reading comprehension or attention to detail. The answer is directly given in the first sentence.\n\nRephrasing: \"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\" Therefore, the capital is Quack.\n\nThe statue being in Quack is irrelevant to the capital question. It might be a red herring, but it doesn''t contradict anything.\n\nSo, the answer should be Quack.\n\nNow, how to present this? Since it''s a straightforward question, I can just state the answer.\n\nFinal answer: Quack."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":35,"completion_tokens":354,"total_tokens":389,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":297},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":35},"system_fingerprint":"fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache"}'
