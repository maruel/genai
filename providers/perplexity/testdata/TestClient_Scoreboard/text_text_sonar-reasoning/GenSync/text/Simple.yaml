Let me check the search results to find appropriate options.\n\nLooking at the first result from Berlitz, they mention 107 ways to say hello, but the key here is a single word. The second result from LanguageTool lists \"Hey\" as a casual synonym of hello. Preply''s third result also includes \"Hey\" and \"Hi\" as part of slang greetings. The Duolingo blog in result four has a table with greetings like \"How are you?\" but those are phrases, not single words. The YouTube video in result five talks about using \"hi\" or \"hey\" as simple greetings.\n\nSo the main single-word options are \"Hello,\" \"Hi,\" and \"Hey.\" \"Hello\" is neutral, \"Hi\" is friendlier, and \"Hey\" is casual. The user specified one word, so these three are the primary choices. I should list them, maybe with brief explanations of each tone. Make sure to cite the sources where these words are mentioned. The Berlitz article [1] and Preply [3] both mention \"hello\" and other single-word greetings. The LanguageTool [2] and Duolingo [4] sources confirm \"Hey\" and \"Hi.\" The YouTube [5] also supports \"hi\" and \"hey\" as one-word greetings.\n\nNeed to present this concisely, using the three options with context. Avoid any extra words, just the one-word greetings and their formality levels. Check if there are other single-word options, but from the results, these three seem to cover it.\n</think>\n\n**Hello** - Neutral greeting for most situations[1][3].  \n**Hi** - Friendly and casual[2][5].  \n**Hey** - Very informal, typically with friends[2][5].  \n\nChoose based on context and formality desired."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
