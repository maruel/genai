I called the tool with the number 132413, and the response was 363.89. I need to make sure that this is the correct result. Let me check by squaring 363.89 to see if it approximates 132413.\n\nCalculating 363.89 squared: 363.89 * 363.89. Let''s do this step by step. \n\nFirst, 360 squared is 129600. Then, 3.89 squared is approximately 15.13. Now, the cross term is 2 * 360 * 3.89 = 2 * 360 * 3.89. 360 * 3.89 is 1,399.8, so doubling that gives 2,799.6. Adding all parts together: 129,600 + 2,799.6 + 15.13 â‰ˆ 132,414.73. \n\nThe original number is 132,413, which is very close to the squared result of 132,414.73. The slight difference is likely due to rounding in the decimal places. So, 363.89 is a correct approximation of the square root of 132413. Therefore, I can confidently return the result as provided by the tool without any additional explanation, as per the user''s request.\n</think>\n\n363.89","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1748549476,"model":"qwen-3-32b","system_fingerprint":"fp_9c2a99947ce8120f4772","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":124,"completion_tokens":378,"total_tokens":502,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}},"time_info":{"queue_time":0.00011876,"prompt_time":0.003465358,"completion_time":0.216157002,"total_time":0.2212529182434082,"created":1748549476}}'
