That''s a simple and clear request. \n\nI wonder why they want just one word - maybe they''re testing if I can follow instructions precisely, or perhaps they''re in a hurry. The tone feels playful though, like a mini-challenge. \n\nOkay, the obvious one-word response is \"Hello\" itself. It''s polite, direct, and fulfills the requirement perfectly. \n\n\"Hi\" would also work but \"Hello\" feels slightly more formal and universal. No need to overcomplicate this - keeping it simple is what they asked for. \n\n...And done.
