        body: '{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Canada ","reasoning_content":"Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   Topic: Canada.\n    *   Requirement: Talk about it in \"great details\".\n    *   Constraint: Start with the exact phrase \"Canada is\".\n\n2.  **Determine the Scope and Structure:**\n    *   To cover Canada in \"great detail,\" I need to touch upon multiple aspects: geography, history, government/politics, economy, culture, demographics, natural resources, climate, and international role.\n    *   The structure should be logical, flowing from basic facts to more nuanced details.\n    *   I need to ensure the opening sentence matches the constraint exactly.\n\n3.  **Drafting - Section by Section:**\n\n    *   **Opening:** Must be \"Canada is\". I''ll complete the sentence to set the tone (e.g., the second-largest country by total area, etc.).\n    *   **Geography:** Location (North America), borders (US, Arctic Ocean, Pacific, Atlantic), provinces/territories, capital (Ottawa), largest city (Toronto), major landforms (Rockies, Prairies, Shield, Mountains).\n    *   **History:** Indigenous peoples (First Nations, Inuit, Métis), European exploration (Vikings, French, British), Confederation (1867), evolution to independence (Statute of Westminster 1931, Constitution Act 1982), immigration waves.\n    *   **Government & Politics:** Constitutional monarchy (King Charles III represented by Governor General), parliamentary democracy (House of Commons, Senate), Prime Minister, federal system (provincial powers), legal system (common law + civil law in Quebec).\n    *   **Economy:** GDP, resource-rich (oil, gas, minerals, timber), trade (USMCA/CUSMA), service sector, banking stability, tech hubs.\n    *   **Demographics & Culture:** Population (approx. 40 million), urbanization, multiculturalism (official policy), official languages (English/French), indigenous reconciliation efforts, cuisine (poutine, maple syrup), sports (hockey, curling).\n    *   **Environment & Climate:** Extreme variety (tropical coast to arctic tundra), natural beauty (national parks), environmental challenges (climate change impact on permafrost/forests).\n    *   **International Relations:** G7, NATO, NORAD, Commonwealth, Francophonie, peacekeeping history, immigration leadership.\n\n4.  **Refining the Content (Adding Detail):**\n    *   *Geo:* Mention the 10 provinces and 3 territories specifically. Mention the coastline length (longest in the world).\n    *   *History:* Mention the War of 1812, WWI/WWII contributions, residential schools (important historical context).\n    *   *Politics:* Mention the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n    *   *Culture:* Mention bilingualism, the concept of \"politeness\" (stereotype but often discussed), healthcare system.\n    *   *Economy:* Mention oil sands, agriculture (wheat).\n\n5.  **Review against Constraints:**\n    *   Does it start with \"Canada is\"? Yes.\n    *   Is it detailed? Yes, covering multiple facets.\n    *   Is the tone appropriate? Informative and comprehensive.\n\n6.  **Drafting the Response (Mental or Scratchpad):**\n    *   *Start:* Canada is... the second-largest nation on Earth...\n    *   *Body Paragraphs:* Group the points logically.\n    *   *Check:* Ensure flow and readability. Avoid making it look like a bullet point list if possible, or use headings for clarity while maintaining narrative flow. Given \"great details,\" structured sections might be better for readability.\n\n7.  **Final Polish:**\n    *   Check for accuracy (e.g., population stats, capital city).\n    *   Ensure the opening phrase is exact.\n    *   Make sure sensitive topics (Indigenous history) are handled respectfully and accurately.\n\n8.  **Final Output Generation:** (Proceeding to generate text based on the above plan).\n\n    *   *Self-Correction during drafting:* I initially thought about just writing one giant block of text. However, for \"great details,\" using subheadings or clear thematic breaks will make it more digestible while still being detailed. I will use bolding for key themes to help navigation.\n    *   *Constraint Check:* \"Start with: Canada is\". I must not add any preamble before this.\n\n    *(Self-Correction)*: Wait, strictly speaking, \"Start with: Canada is\" means the very first characters of my output must be \"Canada is\". I should not include markdown headers before that sentence. I will embed the first sentence as the intro paragraph.\n\n    Let''s assemble the content.\n\n    *   Intro: Geography/Size.\n    *   History: Indigenous -> Colonization -> Confederation -> Modern Nation.\n    *   Government: Monarchy, Parliament, Federalism.\n    *   Economy: Resources, Trade, Tech.\n    *   Society: Immigration, Languages, Healthcare, Education.\n    *   Culture: Arts, Sports, Identity.\n    *   Environment: Climate, Parks, Challenges.\n\n    Okay, ready to write.cw","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"logprobs":null}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":22,"completion_tokens":1206,"total_tokens":1228,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":1128,"text_tokens":1206},"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":22}},"created":1772145347,"system_fingerprint":null,"model":"qwen3.5-122b-a10b","id":"chatcmpl-358557fa-e5f6-989b-887e-bf50890ec37e"}'
