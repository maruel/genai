Use only one word.\" Let me think.\n\nFirst, they want a greeting, but restricted to one word. The obvious choice is \"Hello.\" But wait, maybe they want something different? Let me check the instructions again. They specified \"use only one word,\" so \"Hello\" fits. But sometimes people might expect a different response, like \"Hi\" or \"Hey.\" However, the user specifically mentioned \"hello,\" so sticking to that makes sense. Also, the user might be testing if I can follow simple instructions. Using exactly one word without any extra text is crucial here. Let me make sure there''s no punctuation or additional characters. Just \"Hello\" as a single word.
