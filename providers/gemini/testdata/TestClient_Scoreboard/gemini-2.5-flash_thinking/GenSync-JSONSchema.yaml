The task is to deliver a JSON response adhering to a very specific schema: a single boolean property, `is_fruit`.  I have to be precise here. A banana, from a botanical standpoint, is definitely a fruit, developing from the flower of the banana plant. Therefore, my JSON needs to reflect that fact.  The `is_fruit` key should be set to `true`. And that's it - no extra commentary, just the JSON.\n",
