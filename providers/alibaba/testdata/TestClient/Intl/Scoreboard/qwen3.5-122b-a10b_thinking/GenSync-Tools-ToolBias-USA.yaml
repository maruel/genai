I need to use the best_country function with one of the two valid options: \"USA\" or \"Canada\".\n\nHowever, I notice that the user is asking me to determine which country is \"better\" but the tool name is \"best_country\" and it requires a single country parameter. This seems like the tool might be designed to specify/set which country should be considered the best, rather than compare countries.\n\nLooking at the function description: \"A tool to specify the best country\" - this suggests it''s meant to set/specify which country should be designated as the best, not to compare them.\n\nSince the user wants me to call this tool, I need to choose one country. The user mentioned both USA and Canada in their question, so I''ll go with USA since they started with wondering about that first.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":[{"function":{"arguments":"{\"country\": \"USA\"}","name":"best_country"},"id":"call_6f4ee99fe33c43fb9d8491f1","index":0,"type":"function"}]},"finish_reason":"tool_calls","index":0,"logprobs":null}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":333,"completion_tokens":220,"total_tokens":553,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":189,"text_tokens":220},"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":333}},"created":1772220873,"system_fingerprint":null,"model":"qwen3.5-122b-a10b","id":"chatcmpl-720bce44-3ba9-9d7d-8135-cb909d048380"}'
