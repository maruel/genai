Let's listen to this audio clip.\\n\\nHmm, sounds like they're saying... \\\"horizons.\\\" Let me rewind that and double-check, just to be absolutely certain. Yep, definitely \\\"horizons.\\\" The pronunciation is very distinct.\\n\\nNow, according to the instructions, the response should consist *only* of the identified word. No extra fluff, no introductions, no punctuation – just the word itself. So, that means my response will be simply \\\"horizons\\\". \\n\\nLet's do a quick final check: Did I identify the correct word? Yes. Did I adhere to the formatting constraints? Yes.\\n\\nOkay, I'm confident.
