That's a straightforward question. The answer is definitely \\\"yes.\\\" Botanically, it's even a berry! And culturally, it's almost always considered a fruit as well.\\n\\nNow, the user *specifically* wants a JSON response, and I need to make sure I adhere to the schema: `{\\\"is_fruit\\\": bool}`.  Let me break this down. The key is `\\\"is_fruit\\\"`, and the value needs to be a boolean, which will be either `true` or `false`. Since a banana *is* a fruit, that means the value will be `true`.\\n\\nI'll start building the JSON. Open brace: `{`. Key: `\\\"is_fruit\\\"`. Colon: `:`. Value: `true`. Close brace: `}`.  That gives me `{\\\"is_fruit\\\": true}`.\\n\\nNow, let me double-check all the constraints: did I answer the question? Yes. Is there an explanation? Nope, just the JSON. Am I only replying as JSON? Yes. Does it follow the schema? Absolutely. Is it valid JSON? Of course. Are there any comments? No.\\n\\nAlright, I'm confident that `{\\\"is_fruit\\\": true}` is the correct and complete response.\\n\",\n            \"thought\": true\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"{\\n  \\\"is_fruit\\\": true\\n}\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"role\": \"model\"\n      },\n      \"finishReason\": \"STOP\",\n      \"index\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usageMetadata\": {\n    \"promptTokenCount\": 30,\n    \"candidatesTokenCount\": 11,\n    \"totalTokenCount\": 432,\n    \"promptTokensDetails\": [\n      {\n        \"modality\": \"TEXT\",\n        \"tokenCount\": 30\n      }\n    ],\n    \"thoughtsTokenCount\": 391\n  },\n  \"modelVersion\": \"gemini-2.5-pro\",\n  \"responseId\": \"j2NAaaafKaP5jrEP96CMsQs\"\n}\n"
