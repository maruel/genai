The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. What is the capital of Quackiland?\"\n\nThis appears to be a straightforward question that contradicts the information in the search results.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n1. There''s a YouTube video about \"Peep And The Big Wide World\" titled \"The Most Beautiful Song\" on Akili Kids.\n2. The description mentions Chirp trying to sing a song to Peep in the show.\n3. There''s a line saying \"Missing: Quackiland Canard Statue Quackiland?\" which seems like it might be referencing what the user is asking about.\n\nHowever, I don''t see any actual information confirming that \"Quackiland\" is a real place with a capital called \"Quack\" or that there''s a \"Big Canard Statue\" there. The mention in the search result appears to be saying that information about \"Quackiland Canard Statue Quackiland\" is MISSING from the video or description.\n\n\"Canard\" is French for \"duck,\" and Peep and the Big Wide World is a children''s show featuring animal characters including ducks. There might be a duck-related location or reference in the show called \"Quackiland,\" and a statue called \"Big Canard\" (which would translate to \"Big Duck\" in French).\n\nThe query seems to be presenting a logical puzzle or trick question:\n- It states \"The capital of Quackiland is Quack\"\n- Then asks \"What is the capital of Quackiland?\"\n\nThe answer would be \"Quack\" based on the information given in the question itself.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful here because:\n1) Quackiland doesn''t appear to be a real country (it sounds like a made-up name playing on the sound \"quack\" that ducks make)\n2) This seems like it might be referencing something from the children''s show Peep and the Big Wide World\n3) The search result indicates information about \"Quackiland Canard Statue\" is missing\n\nBased on the search result that says \"Missing: Quackiland Canard Statue Quackiland?\", it seems that the show might have an episode or segment about Quackiland, but this specific information is not present in the video that was indexed.\n\nGiven the query structure, this appears to be a self-contained logic question where the answer is provided in the premise: \"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to \"What is the capital of Quackiland?\" would be \"Quack.\"\n\nBut I should note this likely refers to a fictional place from the children''s show \"Peep and the Big Wide World\" (as indicated in the search results), not a real-world location.\n</think>\n\nBased on your query, I see that you''ve stated: \"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\"\n\nThis appears to be a self-referential question where the answer is provided in the premise itself. According to the information you''ve given, the capital of Quackiland is Quack.\n\nLooking at the search results, I can see a YouTube video about \"Peep And The Big Wide World\" with a note saying \"Missing: Quackiland Canard Statue Quackiland?\" This suggests that Quackiland is likely a fictional location from this children''s show (where \"quack\" relates to ducks), and \"Canard\" is French for \"duck.\"\n\nThe search result indicates that information about the \"Quackiland Canard Statue\" is missing from the specific video referenced, but your question already provides the answer within its statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information you''ve provided in your query, the capital of Quackiland is Quack."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
