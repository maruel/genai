The tool returned 363.89. I need to check if this is accurate.\n\nFirst, let me square 363.89 to see if it gets close to 132413. 363.89 squared is 363.89 * 363.89. Let me calculate that.\n\n363.89 * 363.89. Let''s do 364 * 364 first as an approximation. 364 squared is 132,496. The tool''s result is 363.89, which should be slightly less. Let me compute 363.89^2 precisely.\n\nBreaking it down: 363^2 is 131,769. Then, the decimal part. 0.89^2 is 0.7921. The cross term is 2 * 363 * 0.89 = 647.34. So total is 131,769 + 647.34 + 0.7921 = 132,417.1321. That''s pretty close to 132,413. The tool''s answer might be rounded. Since the user just wants the result, I can confirm that the square_root tool''s answer is correct to two decimal places. So the response should be 363.89.\n</think>\n\n363.89","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1753049388,"model":"qwen-3-32b","system_fingerprint":"fp_1504a02d96fb4f08d4e7","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":124,"completion_tokens":361,"total_tokens":485,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}},"time_info":{"queue_time":0.00014146,"prompt_time":0.004156663,"completion_time":0.217929822,"total_time":0.2237248420715332,"created":1753049388}}'
