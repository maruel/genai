Then it mentions that the Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. So, the capital is Quack. But maybe I should check if there''s any trick here. Sometimes questions might try to mislead, but in this case, the answer is directly stated. The key point is that the capital is named Quack, which is also where the statue is. There''s no conflicting information here. So the answer should be Quack.","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"logprobs":null}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":38,"completion_tokens":206,"total_tokens":244,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":135}},"created":1772128274,"system_fingerprint":null,"model":"qwen3-30b-a3b","id":"chatcmpl-poyZKM6xLfG05ftv"}'
