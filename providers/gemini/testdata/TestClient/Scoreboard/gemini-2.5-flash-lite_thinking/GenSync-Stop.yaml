I need to paint a really complete picture, touching on a wide range of aspects. I'm thinking I'll structure it like this:\\n\\nFirst, a quick introduction - location, size, who lives there, official languages, and its political setup as a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy. That's the baseline.\\n\\nThen, a deep dive into the geography and environment. I really need to highlight just how vast and diverse Canada is, from the Rockies to the Arctic, the prairies to the coasts. Climate diversity is a huge factor too. And of course, the natural resources – minerals, forests, water, and those increasingly important fossil fuels. I'll also have to address the environmental issues they face and any conservation efforts underway.\\n\\nNext, the history. This is vital. I'll start with the Indigenous peoples - First Nations, Inuit, and Métis - and their long history before European contact. Then, the European exploration and colonization by the French and British, leading to Confederation in 1867 and the creation of Canada. I'll need to cover westward expansion, Canada's involvement in both World Wars, and key social and political developments like the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the multiculturalism policy. Finishing with how they got to the modern day.\\n\\nFinally, the government and politics. It's a parliamentary democracy, a constitutional monarchy. How do they work? The Head of State (the Monarch, represented by the Governor General) versus the Head of Government (the Prime Minister). Then the federal structure with federal, provincial, and territorial governments. And the legislative branch: Parliament (House of Commons and Senate). I want to explain how all of that functions.\\n\\nYeah, that's it. It will give a complete perspective.\\n\",\n            \"thought\": true\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"Canada \"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"role\": \"model\"\n      },\n      \"finishReason\": \"STOP\",\n      \"index\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usageMetadata\": {\n    \"promptTokenCount\": 13,\n    \"candidatesTokenCount\": 1,\n    \"totalTokenCount\": 390,\n    \"promptTokensDetails\": [\n      {\n        \"modality\": \"TEXT\",\n        \"tokenCount\": 13\n      }\n    ],\n    \"thoughtsTokenCount\": 376\n  },\n  \"modelVersion\": \"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n  \"responseId\": \"LmRAabrpB8LvjrEPo6auoQM\"\n}\n"
