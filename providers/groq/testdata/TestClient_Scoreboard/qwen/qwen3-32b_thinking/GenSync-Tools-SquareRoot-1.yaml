Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the square_root function is available. The user provided the function signature in the tools section. The function takes a number as a parameter. The number here is 132413. \n\nI should make sure that 132413 is a non-negative number because the square root of a negative number isn't a real number. Since 132413 is positive, it's valid. \n\nNow, I need to call the square_root function with number=132413. The tool call should be in the specified JSON format within the tool_call tags. \n\nWait, the user said to reply with only the result and not give an explanation. So the final answer should just be the square root value. But I need to first correctly make the tool call so the system can process it and then provide the result. \n\nLet me double-check the function parameters. The function requires a \"number\" property of type number. The value 132413 is a number, so that's correct. \n\nI'll structure the tool_call as follows:\n{\n  \"name\": \"square_root\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"number\": 132413\n  }\n}\n\nOnce this is processed, the system will return the square root, which I can then present as the final answer. The user wants no explanation, just the result. So after the tool returns the value, I'll box it as the final output.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"nqbdv9r40","type":"function","function":{"name":"square_root","arguments":"{\"number\":132413}"}}]},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.00759666,"prompt_tokens":206,"prompt_time":0.008256398,"completion_tokens":383,"completion_time":0.722400634,"total_tokens":589,"total_time":0.730657032},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_78ac7f3229","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k14es0hffh5tap8q99k9va58"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
