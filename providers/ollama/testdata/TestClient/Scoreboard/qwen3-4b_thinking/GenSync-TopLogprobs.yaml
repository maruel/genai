Let me think. The instruction is clear: respond with a single word. The word \"hello\" is already one word, so maybe that''s the answer. But wait, the user might be testing if I can do something else. Let me check the rules again. They said \"use only one word,\" so I need to make sure I don''t add anything else. Maybe they want a greeting in another language? But the example given is \"hello,\" so probably just \"hello\" is correct. I should confirm that there''s no trick here.
