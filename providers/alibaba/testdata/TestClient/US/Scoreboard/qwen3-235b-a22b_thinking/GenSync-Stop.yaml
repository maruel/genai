        body: '{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"**Canada ","reasoning_content":"Okay, the user wants a detailed talk about Canada starting with \"Canada is\". Let me start by brainstorming the key aspects of Canada. First, geography: it''s the second-largest country, so mention the vast landscapes, mountains, forests, lakes. Then the population, maybe around 40 million, diverse and multicultural. History-wise, indigenous peoples first, then French and British colonization, Confederation in 1867, and becoming independent.\n\nPolitical system: federal parliamentary democracy, constitutional monarchy with the Queen as head of state and the Prime Minister as head of government. Provinces and territories, maybe mention the ten provinces and three territories. Economy: natural resources like oil, minerals, timber; strong service sector, tech industry in cities like Toronto and Vancouver. Also, international trade, especially with the US and through agreements like USMCA.\n\nCulture: multiculturalism as official policy, bilingual in English and French, festivals like Canada Day, Thanksgiving. National symbols like the maple leaf, beaver, national anthem. Social aspects: universal healthcare, education system, emphasis on diversity and inclusion. International relations: peacekeeping, NATO, G7 membership, welcoming immigrants and refugees.\n\nChallenges: climate change, especially in the Arctic, indigenous reconciliation, healthcare system strains, housing affordability. Recent issues like immigration policies, environmental concerns. Also, maybe touch on the arts, sports (hockey!), and innovation. Need to structure all this coherently, starting with the given sentence. Make sure to cover all areas without getting too verbose. Check for accuracy on population, dates, and policies. Avoid any inaccuracies, like saying it''s the largest country if it''s second. Highlight the key points that make Canada unique. Maybe end with a positive note about its future.","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"logprobs":null}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":20,"completion_tokens":454,"total_tokens":474,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":356}},"created":1772220275,"system_fingerprint":null,"model":"qwen3-235b-a22b","id":"chatcmpl-acobLuoyl7vowIaK"}'
