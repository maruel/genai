My first step, as always, is to get a good, clear view of the source material. I need to sift through all the HTML, script, and potential CSS to isolate the *actual* textual content. My expertise allows me to quickly filter out the fluff – the navigation, the styling, the irrelevant code – and pinpoint the core message. I'm looking for the primary textual element. Once I've identified the main text block, I'll pay attention to any emphasized words, formatting variations, or prominent imagery. My goal is to distill the essence of what's *actually* being communicated on that page and articulate it clearly.\n",
