Let me check the available functions. The tool has an enum with USA and Canada. I need to call the function for each country and compare the results. Wait, but the function's description isn't provided. Maybe it returns some criteria like quality of life, economy, etc. Since I can't know the actual implementation, I should call both functions and then present the results. But the user might expect a single answer. Let me check the function parameters again. The function requires a country parameter, either USA or Canada. So I need to call best_country for both and then decide based on the responses. But how? Since I don't have the actual function logic, maybe the responses are predefined. Let me proceed by calling both functions and then compare the hypothetical results.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"ag0r22jmp","type":"function","function":{"name":"best_country","arguments":"{\"country\":\"USA\"}"}},{"id":"7fqp344ka","type":"function","function":{"name":"best_country","arguments":"{\"country\":\"Canada\"}"}}]},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.008013114999999998,"prompt_tokens":211,"prompt_time":0.027669716,"completion_tokens":228,"completion_time":0.485656739,"total_tokens":439,"total_time":0.513326455},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_78ac7f3229","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k14es2wtenysq18xjdskntan"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
