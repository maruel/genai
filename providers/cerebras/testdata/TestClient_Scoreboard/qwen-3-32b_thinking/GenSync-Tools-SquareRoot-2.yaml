The tool returned 363.89. Let me check if that''s accurate. First, I''ll square 363.89 to see if it gets close to 132413. \n\nCalculating 363.89 squared: 363.89 * 363.89. Let''s break this down. 360 squared is 129,600. Then, 3.89 squared is about 15.13. Now, the cross term is 2*360*3.89. Let''s see, 360*3.89 is 1,399.8, multiplied by 2 gives 2,799.6. Adding all together: 129,600 + 2,799.6 + 15.13 = 132,414.73. Hmm, that''s very close to 132,413. The tool''s result seems correct, maybe rounded to two decimal places. \n\nWait, the exact value might be a bit less. Let me verify with a calculator. If I take 363.89^2, it''s approximately 132,414.73, which is just 1.73 more than 132,413. So, the square root of 132,413 is slightly less than 363.89. The tool probably rounded up, so the user gets an approximate value. Since the user only asked for the result without explanation, I should just present the given answer. Unless there''s a need for higher precision, but the instructions don''t mention that. Alright, I''ll go with the provided result.\n</think>\n\n363.89","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1755298809,"model":"qwen-3-32b","system_fingerprint":"fp_c8e8cd78ea58dce346b0","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":83,"completion_tokens":424,"total_tokens":507,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}},"time_info":{"queue_time":0.00018356,"prompt_time":0.004239302,"completion_time":0.313968983,"total_time":0.3202998638153076,"created":1755298809}}'
