They wanted the square root of 132413 using the square_root tool. The tool returned 363.89. I need to verify if this is accurate.\n\nFirst, I''ll calculate 363.89 squared to see if it approximates 132413. 363.89 * 363.89. Let me break this down. 360 squared is 129600. Then, 3.89 squared is roughly 15.1321. Now, the cross term: 2*360*3.89. That''s 720*3.89. Let me compute 700*3.89 = 2723 and 20*3.89 = 77.8, adding up to 2723 + 77.8 = 2800.8. So total is 129600 + 2800.8 + 15.1321 = 132415.9321. That''s very close to 132413, with a slight overestimation. \n\nBut since square roots can have multiple decimal places, maybe the tool rounded it. Let me check with a calculator. The square root of 132413 is approximately 363.885... So rounding to two decimal places would give 363.89. That makes sense. The user specified to reply with only the result, so I should just present 363.89 without any explanation. Got it.\n</think>\n\n363.89","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1753545381,"model":"qwen-3-32b","system_fingerprint":"fp_d92e1e5be69bb839ccfe","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":83,"completion_tokens":385,"total_tokens":468,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}},"time_info":{"queue_time":0.000387199,"prompt_time":0.002615065,"completion_time":0.201304992,"total_time":0.20555782318115234,"created":1753545381}}'
