I remember that Canada''s Prime Ministers are usually from the Liberal Party or the Conservative Party. The previous one was Justin Trudeau, right? He was re-elected in 2019 and 2021. Wait, is there any recent change? I should check if there''s any new information. But the user wants only one result. I need to be sure. Let me recall. As of the last election in 2021, Justin Trudeau is still the Prime Minister. There hasn''t been any announcement of a new PM. So the answer should be Justin Trudeau.
