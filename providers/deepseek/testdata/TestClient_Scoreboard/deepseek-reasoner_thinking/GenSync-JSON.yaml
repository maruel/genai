Botanically, fruits are the mature ovaries of flowering plants, and bananas fit that definition.\n\nThe user specifies: \"Do not include an explanation. Reply ONLY as JSON according to the provided schema: {\"is_fruit\": bool}.\"\n\nSo, I must reply with a JSON object only. The schema given is {\"is_fruit\": bool}, which means I need to have a key \"is_fruit\" with a boolean value.\n\nSince a banana is a fruit, the value should be true.\n\nMy response should be strictly in JSON format, with no additional text or explanation.
