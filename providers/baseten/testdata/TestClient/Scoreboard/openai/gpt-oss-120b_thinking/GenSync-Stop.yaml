Despite its massive size, Canada’s population is about 38 million people (2024 estimate), giving it one of the lowest population densities of any major nation. The country is a constitutional monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy, with English and French recognized as its two official languages and a rich mosaic of Indigenous, immigrant, and settler cultures.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Geography and Climate  \n\n| Region | Key Features | Climate |\n|--------|--------------|----------|\n| **Atlantic Canada** (Newfoundland & Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick) | Rugged coastline, the Bay of Fundy (world’s highest tidal range), historic fishing villages. | Cool‑moderate maritime; heavy precipitation, especially in winter. |\n| **Central Canada** (Quebec, Ontario) | Great Lakes basin, Ottawa River, expansive boreal forest; Toronto and Montreal are Canada’s two largest cities. | Humid continental: hot, humid summers; cold, snowy winters. |\n| **Prairie Provinces** (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta) | Fertile plains, vast wheat fields, oil sands (Alberta), and the Canadian Shield’s edge. | Continental, with very cold winters and hot, dry summers; frequent thunderstorms. |\n| **West Coast** (British Columbia) | Pacific coastline, coastal rainforests, the Rocky Mountains, and the island of Vancouver. | Mild, rainy winter on the coast; interior valleys have more continental climate. |\n| **North** (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut) | Arctic tundra, permafrost, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the Northwest Passage. | Polar climate: long, extreme winters, short cool summers; northern lights (aurora borealis) are spectacular. |\n\nThe country’s physical geography is dominated by the **Canadian Shield**, a Precambrian granite formation covering roughly 50 % of Canada, rich in minerals such as nickel, copper, and gold. The **Rocky Mountains**, **Appalachian** range, and a network of thousands of lakes (including the Great Lakes, which contain about 20 % of the world’s fresh water) contribute to breathtaking scenery and support a thriving outdoor tourism industry.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
