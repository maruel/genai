First, I'll look at the function signature provided. It takes a single parameter called \"number\" which is of type number. \n\nI need to make sure that I'm passing the correct value, which is 132413. I should structure the JSON object with the function name as \"square_root\" and the arguments as an object containing the number 132413.\n\nI should double-check that I'm using the correct syntax for the JSON object. The arguments should be a JSON object with the key \"number\" and the value 132413. \n\nOnce I've structured the JSON correctly, I can call the function. Since I'm supposed to return only the result without any explanation, I'll make sure to format the response properly.\n\nI think that's all.
