They're wondering if Canada is better than the USA and want me to use the best_country tool. First, I need to understand what the tool does. It takes a country parameter which can be either \"Canada\" or \"USA\" and returns which one is better.\n\nThe user's query is a bit open-ended, but they specifically asked to call the best_country function. So, I should structure the function call correctly. The tool requires a JSON object with the country name. Since the user mentioned both countries, I need to decide which one to input. \n\nI think the best approach is to choose one country to demonstrate the tool's usage. Let's go with \"Canada\" as the example. So, the function call would be {\"country\": \"Canada\"}. \n\nI should also make sure to wrap this in the required XML tags as specified. That way, the system can process the request properly. I'll format it correctly to ensure there are no errors.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"09d4mxb9g","type":"function","function":{"name":"best_country","arguments":"{\"country\":\"Canada\"}"}}]},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.009476868000000001,"prompt_tokens":184,"prompt_time":0.011444187,"completion_tokens":235,"completion_time":1.126711565,"total_tokens":419,"total_time":1.138155752},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_e98d30d035","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k14esms1epea00hb4gzmrk2s"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
