We should use a more precise calculation.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute it step by step:\n\n Let me calculate:\n  363^2 = 131769\n  364^2 = 132496\n\n Since 132413 is between 131769 and 132496, the square root is between 363 and 364.\n\n We can compute more precisely:\n\n Let x = 363.5\n  (363.5)^2 = (363 + 0.5)^2 = 363^2 + 2*363*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 131769 + 363 + 0.25 = 132132.25\n\n 132413 - 132132.25 = 280.75\n\n Now, we need to add a fraction beyond 363.5. Let that fraction be d, so:\n   (363.5 + d)^2 = 132413\n   => 363.5^2 + 2*363.5*d + d^2 = 132413\n   => 132132.25 + 727*d + d^2 = 132413\n   => 727*d + d^2 = 280.75\n\n Since d is small, we can approximate by ignoring d^2:\n   d ≈ 280.75 / 727 ≈ 0.386\n\n So, 363.5 + 0.386 = 363.886\n\n Therefore, the square root is approximately 363.886, which rounds to 363.89.\n\n However, the tool returned 363.89, which is a rounded value to two decimal places.\n\n But note: the problem says \"reply with only the result\". The tool returned 363.89, but we must consider if the problem expects a more precise result.\n\n The instruction says: \"Use the square_root tool\". Therefore, we should output the result from the tool.\n\n But wait, the tool we have is the one that we are simulating? Actually, in the context of this problem, we are to use the tool that we are provided with.\n\n Since the tool returned 363.89, we should output that.\n\n However, let me double-check with a calculator:\n\n  363.89 * 363.89 = ?\n\n  Let me compute:\n    363.89 * 363.89\n\n    = (360 + 3.89)^2\n    = 360^2 + 2*360*3.89 + (3.89)^2\n    = 129600 + 2800.8 + 15.1321\n    = 129600 + 2800.8 = 132400.8 + 15.1321 = 132415.9321\n\n  That is actually 132415.9321, which is slightly above 132413.\n\n  So 363.89 might be a bit too high.\n\n  Alternatively, let me compute 363.88:\n\n    363.88 * 363.88\n    = (360 + 3.88)^2\n    = 360^2 + 2*360*3.88 + (3.88)^2\n    = 129600 + 2793.6 + 15.0544\n    = 129600 + 2793.6 = 132393.6 + 15.0544 = 132408.6544\n\n  Now, 132413 - 132408.6544 = 4.3456\n\n  So we need to add a little more. Let that be e, then:\n\n    2 * 363.88 * e ≈ 4.3456\n    e ≈ 4.3456 / (727.76) ≈ 0.00597\n\n  So 363.88 + 0.00597 ≈ 363.88597\n\n  Therefore, to two decimal places, we would round to 363.89.\n\n  But wait, 363.88597 rounded to two decimal places is 363.89? \n    363.88597: the third decimal is 5, so we round up the second decimal from 8 to 9? \n    Actually, the number is 363.88597: \n        The thousandths place is 5, which is followed by 97 (so we round up the hundredths place from 8 to 9).\n\n  Therefore, 363.88597 rounded to two decimal places is 363.89.\n\n  However, our calculation of 363.88 squared was 132408.6544 and we needed 132413, so the next increment (0.01) would be:\n\n    We can also check 363.89 squared: we did 363.89^2 and got 132415.9321, which is 2.9321 over.\n\n  The exact square root of 132413 is an irrational number, and we are rounding to two decimal places.\n\n  The tool returned 363.89, so we will output that.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Use the square_root tool\", so we must use the tool''s result.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is 363.89.\n\n However, the tool in the conversation above returned 363.89, so that is the result we should output.\n\n But wait, the assistant initially called the tool and got 363.89? Actually, in the conversation:\n\n    Human: Use the square_root tool to calculate the square root of 132413 and reply with only the result. Do not give an explanation.\n\n    Assistant: function call: square_root with number=132413\n\n    Tool: 363.89\n\n  So the tool returned 363.89.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer is 363.89."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":62,"completion_tokens":1289,"total_tokens":1351,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":1284},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":62},"system_fingerprint":"fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache"}'
