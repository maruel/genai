They want a JSON response with just \"is_fruit\": true or false. Let me think. Botanically, a fruit is the part of the plant that develops from the flower and contains seeds. Bananas are berries actually, since they come from the flower's ovary and have seeds (even though some are very small now). So yes, it's a fruit.
