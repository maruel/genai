I called the tool with the number 132413 and got back 363.89. Now I need to present just the result. Let me check if 363.89 squared is approximately 132413.\n\nCalculating 363.89 * 363.89: Let''s see, 360 squared is 129600. Then 3.89 squared is about 15.13. The cross term is 2*360*3.89 = 2*360*3.89. Let me compute that: 720*3.89. 700*3.89 is 2723, and 20*3.89 is 77.8, so total 2723 + 77.8 = 2800.8. So total square is 129600 + 2800.8 + 15.13  132415.93. That''s pretty close to 132413, considering the approximation. So 363.89 is correct. I should just output the result as per the user''s request.","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"logprobs":null}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":83,"completion_tokens":318,"total_tokens":401,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":307}},"created":1772221111,"system_fingerprint":null,"model":"qwen3-30b-a3b","id":"chatcmpl-OyrygMlxNnYfa6H3"}'
