The user is asking me to calculate the square root of 132413 using the square_root tool and reply only with the result, no explanation. Hmm, in the previous interaction, they provided a tool call and then the result was 363.89. So they want me to do the same now.\n\nWait, but in the new query, they just said \"Use the square_root tool...\" and then immediately provided the tool output. Maybe they're testing if I can recognize the pattern. I should make sure I'm following their instructions correctly.\n\nI need to ensure that I only output the result, without any extra text. So when they give me the number, I'll use the tool to get the square root and then provide the answer as they did before.
