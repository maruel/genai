        body: '{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"","reasoning_content":"The user is asking me to compare USA and Canada and wants me to call the \"best_country\" tool to determine which country is better. Looking at the available tool, I can see that \"best_country\" takes a country parameter that can be either \"USA\" or \"Canada\".\n\nHowever, the user is asking me to choose which country is \"better\", but the tool seems to be designed to specify/set the best country rather than compare them. Since the user specifically asked me to call the tool to tell them which country is the best one, I should make the tool call. But I need to decide which country to specify as the best.\n\nLooking at this more carefully, the tool description says \"A tool to specify the best country\" with parameters for either USA or Canada. This suggests I need to pick one. Since the user is asking me to determine which is better and call the tool, I should probably pick one of them. However, this seems like a subjective judgment call.\n\nActually, looking at the instructions again, it says \"DO NOT try to answer the question itself - just call the function\". The user is asking me to call the tool to tell them which country is best, so I should call the function. But I need to choose which country to specify.\n\nSince this appears to be a subjective comparison and I don''t have objective criteria to determine which is \"better\", I''ll make the tool call with one of the options. Let me use \"USA\" as that''s what the user mentioned first in their question about whether it''s better than Canada.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":[{"function":{"arguments":"{\"country\": \"USA\"}","name":"best_country"},"id":"call_a2f62de690994c09a6b26d78","index":0,"type":"function"}]},"finish_reason":"tool_calls","index":0,"logprobs":null}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":333,"completion_tokens":352,"total_tokens":685,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":321,"text_tokens":352},"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":333}},"created":1772221370,"system_fingerprint":null,"model":"qwen3.5-35b-a3b","id":"chatcmpl-fa81a505-8c08-9ef1-90bf-38e5bf2659c6"}'
