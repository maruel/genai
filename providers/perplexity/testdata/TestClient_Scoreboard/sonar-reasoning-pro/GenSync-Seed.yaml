The sources confirm:\n- \"Hello\" is the basic, most common greeting [1][3]\n- It works in both formal and informal contexts [1][2][4]\n- Unlike \"Hey\" which is more casual, \"Hello\" has no restrictions [2][4]\n\nThe user specifically asked for one word, so I must keep it minimal. Among all greeting options (\"Hi\", \"Hey\", \"What''s up\"), \"Hello\" is the most versatile single-word choice according to the research. \n\nWhile the sources mention many alternatives, the instruction is clear - respond with just one word. No explanation needed since the user didn''t ask for elaboration. \n\nSimply returning \"Hello\" fulfills all requirements: it''s one word, it''s the most standard greeting, and matches what the sources identify as the fundamental English greeting.\n</think>\nHello"}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
