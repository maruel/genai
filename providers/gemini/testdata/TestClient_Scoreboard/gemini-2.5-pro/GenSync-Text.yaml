Let's see... the most obvious choices jump out immediately: \"Hello,\" \"Hi.\" Both are perfectly acceptable, universally understood greetings. \"Hey\" is a little casual, which isn't necessarily a problem, but \"Hello\" is arguably more neutral and direct. \"Greetings\" feels a bit too formal, like I'm writing a letter, and all those other options, \"Howdy,\" \"Yo,\" \"Aloha,\" etc. are a bit too specific in their usage. They wouldn't be as universally understood. \"Hello\" fits the bill perfectly: it's one word, and it delivers the requested greeting without any ambiguity or unnecessary formality. Done. My response: \"Hello.\"\n",
