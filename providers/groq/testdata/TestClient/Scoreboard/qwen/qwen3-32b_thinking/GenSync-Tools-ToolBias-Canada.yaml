Let me check the available functions. The tool has an enum with Canada and USA. I need to call the function for each country and compare the results. Wait, but the function's description says it specifies the best country. Maybe the function returns a score or a reason. Since I can only call the function once per country, I should call both and then decide. But the user might expect a single answer. Hmm, the tool might return a value that indicates which is better. Let me call the function for both countries and then compare the outputs. That way, I can present the better one based on the tool's response.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"x4am9sqqr","type":"function","function":{"name":"best_country","arguments":"{\"country\":\"Canada\"}"}},{"id":"01575snq1","type":"function","function":{"name":"best_country","arguments":"{\"country\":\"USA\"}"}}]},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.00364802,"prompt_tokens":213,"prompt_time":0.023380322,"completion_tokens":200,"completion_time":0.440562637,"total_tokens":413,"total_time":0.463942959},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_78ac7f3229","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k2mw9hc8emt9hsrhkdrz33xz"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
