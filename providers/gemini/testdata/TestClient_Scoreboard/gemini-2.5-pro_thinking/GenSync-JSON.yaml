It seems straightforward: they want to know if a banana is a fruit. Simple enough.\n\nOkay, is a banana a fruit? Absolutely, without a doubt. From a botanical perspective, it's a berry, and even in culinary terms, it's generally accepted as a fruit. So that's settled.\n\nNow, the instructions are very specific. I need to deliver *only* a JSON response. No pleasantries, no explanations, just pure data. The schema, thankfully, is simple: `{\"is_fruit\": bool}`. So, the JSON will contain a single key-value pair, with \"is_fruit\" as the key and a boolean (`true` or `false`) as the value.\n\nSince the answer is \"yes,\" the boolean needs to be `true`. So, combining everything, the response should be `{\"is_fruit\": true}`.\n\nBefore I commit, I'll quickly double-check: is it valid JSON? Yup. Does it strictly adhere to the schema? Absolutely. No extraneous text? Nope. Looks good to go.\n",
