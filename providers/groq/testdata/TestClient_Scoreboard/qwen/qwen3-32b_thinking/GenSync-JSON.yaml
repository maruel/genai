They want a JSON response with a boolean value for \"is_fruit\". Let me recall my knowledge about plant biology. A fruit, in botanical terms, is the mature ovary of a flowering plant, usually containing seeds. Bananas grow from the flower of the banana plant, and the part we eat is the fleshy part of the fruit. Even though some people might not think of it as a fruit in the culinary sense, botanically it's a fruit. So the answer should be true. The user also specified not to include an explanation, just the JSON. I need to make sure the JSON matches the schema exactly. No extra fields, just \"is_fruit\": true. Let me double-check that. Yeah, that's correct.\n"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.001911277,"prompt_tokens":49,"prompt_time":0.012890404,"completion_tokens":178,"completion_time":0.417705494,"total_tokens":227,"total_time":0.430595898},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_78ac7f3229","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k2mw9erae63r3d876fqzf8fj"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
