I called the function with number 132413. The tool response came back as 363.89. Now I need to just reply with the result without any explanation.\n\nWait, the user said \"reply with only the result\". So I should output just the number 363.89. Let me check if that''s correct. The square root of 132413... Hmm, 363 squared is 363*363. Let me verify: 360^2 is 129600, 3^2 is 9, and 2*360*3=2160. So (360+3)^2 = 129600 + 2160 +9 = 131769. Then 364^2 is (363+1)^2 = 363^2 + 2*363 +1 = 131769 +726 +1= 132496. Oh, 132496 is 364 squared. The user''s number is 132413, which is 132496 -83, so the square root should be just a bit less than 364. The tool gave 363.89, which makes sense because 363.89^2 would be approximately 132413. Let me check with calculator steps. 363.89 * 363.89. Let''s see, 363^2 is 131769, 0.89^2 is 0.7921, and cross term 2*363*0.89 = 655.86. So total is 131769 + 655.86 +0.7921 ≈ 132425.65. Wait, that''s a bit higher than 132413. Hmm, maybe the tool''s answer is approximate. But the user just wants the result from the tool, so I should present 363.89 as is.\n\nThe user said \"do not give an explanation\", so I''ll just write 363.89."}}],"created":1772373955,"model":"Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507-Q4_K_M.gguf","system_fingerprint":"b8180-d979f2b17","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":554,"prompt_tokens":255,"total_tokens":809},"id":"chatcmpl-L8huC0SrbdvxIPFIU2D2BvDJkOoznr6E","timings":{"cache_n":0,"prompt_n":255,"prompt_ms":1721.526,"prompt_per_token_ms":6.751082352941177,"prompt_per_second":148.12439661091378,"predicted_n":554,"predicted_ms":29443.137,"predicted_per_token_ms":53.14645667870036,"predicted_per_second":18.815929837910954}}'
