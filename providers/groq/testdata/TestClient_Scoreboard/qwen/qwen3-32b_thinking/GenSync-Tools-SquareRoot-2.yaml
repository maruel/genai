Let me check the tool response. The tool gave 363.89. I need to make sure that's accurate. Let me verify by squaring 363.89. 363.89 squared is (363.89)*(363.89). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 360 squared is 129600. Then, 3.89 squared is about 15.13. Now, the cross term: 2*360*3.89 = 2*360*3.89 = 720*3.89. Let's compute 700*3.89 = 2723 and 20*3.89=77.8, so total 2723+77.8=2800.8. Adding all parts: 129600 + 2800.8 +15.13 ≈ 132415.93. The original number is 132413, so the square of 363.89 is approximately 132415.93, which is a bit higher. The difference is about 2.93. So maybe the square root is a little less than 363.89. Let me check 363.88 squared. \n\n363.88 squared: (363.89 - 0.01)^2 = 363.89^2 - 2*363.89*0.01 + 0.01^2 ≈ 132415.93 - 7.2778 + 0.0001 ≈ 132408.65. That's lower than 132413. The actual square root is between 363.88 and 363.89. The exact value would require more precise calculation, but the tool provided 363.89. Since the user asked for the result without explanation, I should just present the tool's answer. Maybe they want a rounded value. Let me see, 363.89 is the given result. So I'll just output that.\n"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.008056918000000001,"prompt_tokens":237,"prompt_time":0.010198793,"completion_tokens":546,"completion_time":0.971886061,"total_tokens":783,"total_time":0.982084854},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_78ac7f3229","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k14es1aheh6a6s92y86y5ass"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
