Hmm, that's pretty straightforward, right? I mean, the simplest response would just be \"Hello.\" But wait, maybe I should consider if there are any other possibilities. Could they want a different greeting? Like \"Hi\" or \"Hey\" instead? But the instruction was specificâ€”only one word and to say hello. So \"Hello\" seems like the correct choice. I don't think I need to overcomplicate it. Just stick with the basic greeting.
