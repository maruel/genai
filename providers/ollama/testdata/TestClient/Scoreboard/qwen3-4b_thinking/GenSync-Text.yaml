Wait, the instruction says \"only one word,\" so \"Hi\" is acceptable. Alternatively, \"Hey\" is another possibility. But \"Hi\" is the most standard. Let me check if there''s any other single-word greeting. Maybe \"Salut\" in French, but that''s not English. The user probably expects an English word. So \"Hi\" is the safest choice.
