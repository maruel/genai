The user is asking about the capital of Quackiland. The problem states that the capital of Quackiland is Quack. Then it mentions that the Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. The question is, what is the capital of Quackiland?\\n\\nHmm, so first, the problem directly says \\\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\\\" So regardless of the other information about the statue, the capital should be Quack. The mention of the Big Canard Statue being in Quack might be a red herring, trying to distract or confuse. But the key point is the first sentence. Sometimes these questions include extra details to test if you're paying attention to the relevant information.\\n\\nWait, let me read it again. \\\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack. The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. What is the capital of Quackiland?\\\" So they're repeating the question after giving the answer. Maybe it's a trick question where people might overthink it because of the statue's name. \\\"Canard\\\" is French for duck, and \\\"Quack\\\" is a duck sound, so maybe there's a play on words here. But the answer is straightforward: the capital is Quack. The statue's location just confirms that Quack is a place where the statue is, but the capital is already stated as Quack. So the answer should be Quack.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of Quackiland is **Quack**. \\n\\nThe question explicitly states, *\\\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\\\"* The additional detail about the Big Canard Statue being located in Quack is irrelevant to the question asked. While the name \\\"Canard\\\" (French for \\\"duck\\\") and \\\"Quack\\\" may hint at wordplay, the answer is directly provided in the premise. \\n\\n**Answer:** Quack.\",\n        \"tool_calls\": [],\n        \"reasoning\": null\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\",\n      \"seed\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 40,\n    \"total_tokens\": 428,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 388\n  }\n}"
