The user wants the square root of 132413, and they want me to use the square_root tool. First, I need to check if the tool is available. Yes, there''s a square_root function that takes a number as a string. Wait, the parameters for the function require the number to be a string type. So even though 132413 is a number, I should pass it as a string. I''ll format the JSON correctly with \"number\": \"132413\". Then, call the function and return the result directly without any extra text. The user emphasized to reply with only the result, so I need to make sure there''s no explanation. Let me double-check the tool''s parameters to avoid any errors. All set, I''ll execute the tool call now.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":239,"total_tokens":426,"completion_tokens":187,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}'
