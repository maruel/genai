Let me start by recalling the information given. The first sentence says, \"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\" Then it mentions, \"The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack.\" The question is, \"What is the capital of Quackiland?\" \n\nWait, the first sentence already explicitly states that the capital is Quack. But maybe there''s a trick here? Sometimes questions are designed to test if you pay attention to details. Let me check again. The first sentence directly answers the question. The second sentence provides additional information about the Big Canard Statue being in Quack, which is the capital. So even though the second sentence adds more context, the first sentence is the direct answer. \n\nI need to make sure there''s no ambiguity. The user might be testing if I can recognize that the answer is already given in the first statement. Sometimes people might try to mislead by adding extra info. But in this case, the answer is straightforward. The capital is Quack, as stated. The second sentence just reinforces that Quack is the capital by mentioning a statue there. \n\nSo the answer should be Quack. There''s no need to overcomplicate it. The user probably wants to confirm that the answer is indeed Quack. Maybe they''re checking if I can spot the direct answer without getting confused by the additional information. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer is Quack.\n</think>\n\nThe capital of Quackiland is **Quack**. This is explicitly stated in the first sentence: *\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\"* The second sentence, mentioning the Big Canard Statue in Quack, further confirms that Quack is the capital.
