The expected output is a greeting. The most common greeting in English is \\\"Hello\\\".\\n    *   \\\"Use only one word.\\\" - This is the primary constraint. The response must be a single word. No punctuation, no extra phrases, no emojis, no \\\"Sure, I can do that!\\\" Just one word.\\n\\n2.  **Brainstorm potential one-word greetings:**\\n    *   Hello\\n    *   Hi\\n    *   Hey\\n    *   Greetings\\n    *   Salutations\\n    *   Yo\\n    *   Howdy\\n    *   Hola\\n    *   Bonjour\\n    *   G'day\\n\\n3.  **Evaluate the options against the request:**\\n    *   The user literally said \\\"Say hello.\\\" The most direct, literal, and unambiguous response that also satisfies the \\\"one word\\\" constraint is the word \\\"Hello\\\" itself.\\n    *   \\\"Hi\\\" is also a good option. It's a common one-word greeting. It's slightly more informal.\\n    *   \\\"Hey\\\" is also common, but can sometimes feel a bit more like an attention-getter than a pure greeting.\\n    *   \\\"Greetings\\\" is a bit more formal and less common in casual digital interaction, but it's a valid one-word greeting.\\n    *   \\\"Salutations\\\" is even more formal and a bit archaic. Probably overkill.\\n    *   \\\"Yo\\\" is very informal. Might not be appropriate depending on the perceived context (though there's very little context here).\\n    *   \\\"Howdy\\\" is regional (American South/West). Good, but maybe not the most universally understood.\\n    *   \\\"Hola,\\\" \\\"Bonjour,\\\" etc., are greetings in other languages. A nice touch, but the user's request was in English, so an English response is the most direct and logical choice.\\n\\n4.  **Select the best response:**\\n    *   \\\"Hello\\\" is the perfect choice. It directly echoes the user's command. It's neutral, universally understood as a greeting, and it conforms precisely to the \\\"one word\\\" rule. It's the simple, elegant, and correct answer.\\n    *   \\\"Hi\\\" is a very close second. It's perfectly valid. But \\\"Hello\\\" is the word the user *used*. Responding with that exact word shows I've understood the request perfectly, including the specific vocabulary.\\n\\n5.  **Final Polish:**\\n    *   The request is \\\"Use only one word.\\\" So the final output must be *just* the word. No period at the end. No \\\"Hello!\\\". Just `Hello`.\\n\\nThis leads to the final, concise answer: `Hello`.\"\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\",\n      \"seed\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 13,\n    \"total_tokens\": 593,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 580\n  }\n}"
