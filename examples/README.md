The naming convention is `<input modalities>_to_<output modalities>_<particularity>`.

- txt is for text
- img is for image
- vid is for video

Other modalities supported at documents (PDF) and audio.

While nearly all providers support text to text, and most support tools, only a few support the more complex
modalities.
