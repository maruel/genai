Let me think about the simplest way to do that. The most straightforward one-word greeting is \"Hello\" itself. But wait, maybe they want something more creative? Let me check if there are other one-word alternatives. Words like \"Hi\" or \"Hey\" come to mind, but those are still just variations. The user didn''t specify any restrictions beyond one word, so \"Hello\" should work. Let me make sure there''s no hidden requirement here. The instruction is clear: use only one word.
