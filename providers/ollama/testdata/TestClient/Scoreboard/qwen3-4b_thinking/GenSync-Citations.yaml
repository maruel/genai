The question is asking for the capital of Quackiland. The given information is that the capital is Quack, and the Big Canard Statue is located in Quack. Wait, so the first sentence says, \"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\" Then the second sentence says, \"The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack.\" So the answer seems straightforward. The capital is Quack. But maybe there''s a trick here? Let me think again.\n\nThe question is phrased as a riddle, maybe? Sometimes these questions have a play on words. The word \"Quack\" could be a pun. Like, \"quack\" as in the sound a duck makes, but also \"Quack\" as a name. But the first sentence clearly states that the capital is Quack. The second sentence just gives more information about the location of the statue. So maybe the answer is just Quack. But maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking that the statue''s location is relevant. But no, the capital is already given. Unless there''s a hidden meaning here. Maybe \"Big Canard\" is a clue? \"Canard\" is a French word for \"duck,\" right? So \"Big Canard\" would be a big duck. But how does that relate to the capital? Maybe the answer is a play on words. If the capital is Quack, and the statue is in Quack, then maybe the answer is still Quack. But maybe there''s a different answer. Wait, maybe the question is a trick where the answer is \"Quack\" but the riddle is about the statue. But no, the first sentence directly states the capital. So maybe the answer is just Quack. I think that''s it. The second sentence is just extra information to maybe confuse or test if you read too much into it. So the answer is Quack.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe capital of Quackiland is **Quack**. The second sentence, mentioning the Big Canard Statue, provides additional context but does not alter the given information. The answer is directly stated in the first sentence. \n\n**Answer:** Quack."},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":59054868249,"load_duration":21184505,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":67014465,"eval_count":452,"eval_duration":28512518828}'
