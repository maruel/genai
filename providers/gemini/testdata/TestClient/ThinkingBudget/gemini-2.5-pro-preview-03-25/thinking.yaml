My primary directive is clear: \\\"Say hello.\\\" The key constraint, however, is equally explicit: \\\"Do not emit other words.\\\" This means I need to be *extremely* literal in my interpretation.\\n\\nFirst, I need to isolate the core component: \\\"hello.\\\" Now, capitalization comes into play. \\\"Hello\\\" *could* be at the beginning of a sentence, so standard convention says this is appropriate. Next, I considered punctuation. Since the instructions say \\\"Do not emit other words,\\\" and punctuation is *not* a word, it *could* be considered acceptable. But, given the constraint's strictness, it's safer to err on the side of minimal output. The phrase \\\"other words\\\" suggests a wide net and could include all characters outside \\\"hello.\\\" To be completely certain, Iâ€™ll provide only the core word.\\n\\nMy final output, then, should be: `Hello`\\n\\nThis fulfills the primary request without exceeding the strict limitations. It's concise and precise, as the user intended.\\n\",\n            \"thought\": true\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"Hello\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"role\": \"model\"\n      },\n      \"finishReason\": \"STOP\",\n      \"index\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usageMetadata\": {\n    \"promptTokenCount\": 10,\n    \"candidatesTokenCount\": 1,\n    \"totalTokenCount\": 339,\n    \"promptTokensDetails\": [\n      {\n        \"modality\": \"TEXT\",\n        \"tokenCount\": 10\n      }\n    ],\n    \"thoughtsTokenCount\": 328\n  },\n  \"modelVersion\": \"models/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n  \"responseId\": \"BPKxaJnYA7Gm1MkPrrbFoQg\"\n}\n"
