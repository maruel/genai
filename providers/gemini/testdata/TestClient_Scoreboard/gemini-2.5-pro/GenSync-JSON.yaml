Seems simple enough, but I need to make sure I get it right and format the response perfectly.\n\nFirst, the answer: yes, a banana *is* a fruit. Botanically, it's a berry, and even in culinary terms, it's categorized as a fruit. So that's the core answer.\n\nNext, the format. The user specifically wants JSON, and nothing else. Just a JSON response following a strict schema. Good, I can work with that.\n\nI've got the schema: `{\"is_fruit\": bool}`.  So, I need an object with the key `\"is_fruit\"` and a boolean value. The answer is \"yes,\" so that means the boolean will be `true`.\n\nLet's build the JSON:  `{\"is_fruit\": true}`. Perfect.\n\nNow, a quick check: valid JSON? Yep. Matches the schema? Absolutely. Any extraneous text? Nope. And does it answer the question?  Definitely!\n\nAlright, ready to deliver the final response.\n",
