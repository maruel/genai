Let me check the available functions. The tool has a function called best_country that takes a country parameter, which can be either Canada or USA. Since the user mentioned both countries, but specifically asked to call the tool, I need to invoke the function for each country. However, the function only accepts one country at a time. So I should call the function twice, once for Canada and once for the USA. Wait, but the user might be expecting a comparison. Maybe the tool is designed to return a ranking or a comparison when both are called. Alternatively, perhaps the function is set up to return which one is better based on some internal logic. Since the parameters only allow one country each time, I'll have to make two separate calls. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly. First, call best_country with Canada, then with the USA, and then compare the results. That way, the user gets the individual assessments, and I can present which one is deemed better based on the tool's responses.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"s8gyb9jw4","type":"function","function":{"name":"best_country","arguments":"{\"country\":\"Canada\"}"}},{"id":"m1gpwep8p","type":"function","function":{"name":"best_country","arguments":"{\"country\":\"USA\"}"}}]},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.007469949000000002,"prompt_tokens":211,"prompt_time":0.008778434,"completion_tokens":276,"completion_time":0.54598044,"total_tokens":487,"total_time":0.554758874},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_78ac7f3229","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k13nmy3rfdt8he2g324rdap8"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
