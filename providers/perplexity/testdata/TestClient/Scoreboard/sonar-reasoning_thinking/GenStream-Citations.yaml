The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack.\\\"\\n\\nThis is actually a logical reasoning question rather than one requiring external information. Since you've explicitly stated that \\\"The capital of Quackiland is Quack,\\\" the answer to \\\"What is the capital of Quackiland?\\\" is directly provided in your question.\\n\\nThe mention of \\\"The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack\\\" further confirms that Quack is a specific place (the capital city), as statues are located in physical places.\\n\\nNote that Quackiland appears to be a fictional location (likely from the \\\"Peep and the Big Wide World\\\" children's show mentioned in the search results), playing on the word \\\"quack\\\" (a duck sound) and \\\"canard\\\" (French for duck). But according to the premises you've given, the capital is definitively Quack.\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}}]}\r\n\r\n"
