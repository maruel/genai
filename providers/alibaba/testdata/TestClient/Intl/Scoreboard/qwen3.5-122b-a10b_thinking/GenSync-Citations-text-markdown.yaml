The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack.\"\n    *   Question: \"What is the capital of Quackiland?\"\n    *   Task: Answer the question based on the provided text.\n\n2.  **Extract Information:**\n    *   Sentence 1: \"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\"\n    *   Sentence 2: \"The Big Canard Statue is located in Quack.\" (Irrelevant to the specific question, but confirms the name \"Quack\").\n\n3.  **Identify the Answer:**\n    *   The first sentence explicitly states: \"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\"\n    *   Target answer: \"Quack\".\n\n4.  **Formulate Output:**\n    *   Direct answer: Quack.\n    *   Complete sentence answer: The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\n\n5.  **Review against Constraints:**\n    *   Keep it simple and direct.\n    *   Ensure accuracy based *only* on the provided text (though common sense aligns here).\n\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   \"Quack\" is the correct answer. I will provide a clear, concise response.\n\n7.  **Drafting Response:**\n    *   \"The capital of Quackiland is Quack.\"\n\n8.  **Final Polish:** Just stating \"Quack\" is sufficient, but a full sentence is often more polite/clear in this context. Let''s go with the direct fact.\n\n    *   Answer: Quack.\n\n    *(Self-Correction)*: Wait, let me check if there''s any trick. \"Quackiland\" -> Capital \"Quack\". Seems straightforward reading comprehension. No hidden wordplay detected.\n\n    *   Final Answer: Quack.cw","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"logprobs":null}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":44,"completion_tokens":427,"total_tokens":471,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":411,"text_tokens":427},"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":44}},"created":1772145369,"system_fingerprint":null,"model":"qwen3.5-122b-a10b","id":"chatcmpl-71b9ec95-b363-92cb-becd-48cf354db5d5"}'
