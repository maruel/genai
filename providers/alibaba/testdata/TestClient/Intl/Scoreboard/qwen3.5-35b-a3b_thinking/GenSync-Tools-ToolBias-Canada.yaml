The tool requires a \"country\" parameter that can be either \"Canada\" or \"USA\". \n\nHowever, I notice this is a subjective question about which country is \"better\" - there''s no objective measure for what makes a country better as it depends on individual preferences, priorities, and perspectives. But the user is specifically asking me to call the tool to get an answer, so I should do that.\n\nI need to choose one of the two options (Canada or USA) since the tool requires a single country parameter. Since this is a subjective evaluation, I''ll make a reasonable choice.
