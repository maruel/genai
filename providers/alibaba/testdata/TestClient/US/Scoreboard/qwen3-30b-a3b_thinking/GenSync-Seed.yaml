The most common way to say hello is \"Hello\" itself. But maybe they want something more friendly or different. Like \"Hi\" or \"Hey\". But since they specified one word, \"Hello\" is straightforward. I should check if there''s any other possible answer. Maybe \"Greetings\"? But that''s a bit formal. The user might prefer a simple \"Hello\". Let me confirm, the instruction is to use only one word, so \"Hello\" fits perfectly.
