I called the tool with the number 132413 and got back 363.89. Now I need to present just the result. Let me check if that''s accurate.\n\nWait, let me verify. 363.89 squared is approximately 363.89 * 363.89. Let me do a quick calculation. 364 squared is 132,496. But 132,413 is a bit less than that. So 363.89 should be slightly less than 364. Let me compute 363.89^2. \n\nBreaking it down: (364 - 0.11)^2 = 364^2 - 2*364*0.11 + 0.11^2. That''s 132,496 - 80.08 + 0.0121 = 132,415.9321. Hmm, but the original number is 132,413, which is a bit lower. So maybe the tool''s answer is a rounded value. But since the user just wants the result from the tool, I should stick with 363.89. Alright, I''ll present that as the answer.","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"logprobs":null}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"prompt_tokens":83,"completion_tokens":328,"total_tokens":411,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":317}},"created":1772142737,"system_fingerprint":null,"model":"qwen3-30b-a3b","id":"chatcmpl-03Bpao8BxI0Loc34"}'
