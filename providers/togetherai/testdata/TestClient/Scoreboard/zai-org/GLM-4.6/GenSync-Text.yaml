Still, it fits the prompt.)\\n    *   \\\"Salutations!\\\" (Even more formal, also fits.)\\n    *   \\\"Yo!\\\" (Informal, fits.)\\n    *   \\\"Howdy!\\\" (Informal/regional, fits.)\\n    *   \\\"Alright?\\\" (In some UK dialects, this is a greeting. It's technically one word or a contraction. Fits.)\\n    *   \\\"Sup?\\\" (Slang, contraction, fits.)\\n\\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the user's tone and intent:**\\n    *   The user's request is very direct and simple: \\\"Say hello.\\\" It's not formal, not informal, not slang. It's neutral.\\n    *   Therefore, the most direct, neutral, and universally understood response is the best choice.\\n    *   \\\"Hello\\\" is the word the user explicitly used in their prompt. Using it back is a direct and faithful fulfillment of the request.\\n    *   \\\"Hi\\\" is also a very strong candidate. It's simple, one word, and a common greeting.\\n    *   \\\"Hey\\\" is a bit more informal than \\\"Hi.\\\"\\n    *   \\\"Greetings,\\\" \\\"Salutations,\\\" etc., are too formal for this simple request.\\n    *   \\\"Yo,\\\" \\\"Sup,\\\" \\\"Howdy\\\" are too informal or regional for a neutral first interaction.\\n\\n4.  **Select the best option:**\\n    *   \\\"Hello\\\" is perfect because it *exactly* matches the user's command (\\\"Say hello\\\"). It's the most literal and direct answer.\\n    *   \\\"Hi\\\" is also excellent. It's slightly more casual but still perfectly acceptable.\\n    *   Between \\\"Hello\\\" and \\\"Hi,\\\" \\\"Hello\\\" feels like the most precise and \\\"correct\\\" answer to the specific phrasing of the prompt. It shows I've read carefully.\\n\\n5.  **Final check against the constraints:**\\n    *   Is it a greeting? Yes.\\n    *   Is it one word? Yes.\\n    *   Does it fulfill the user's request? Yes, perfectly.\\n\\n6.  **Construct the final response:**\\n    *   The final output should be just the single word, no extra punctuation, no explanation, no apology, no \\\"Here is your one-word response:\\\". Just the word itself. The user's constraint is absolute (\\\"Use only one word\\\").\\n\\nThis leads me to the final answer: \\\"Hello\\\". It's the most direct, literal, and compliant response.\"\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\",\n      \"seed\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 13,\n    \"total_tokens\": 611,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 598\n  }\n}"
