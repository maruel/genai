Let me recall the definition of a fruit. Botanically, a fruit is the mature ovary of a flowering plant, usually containing seeds. Bananas do develop from the flower of the banana plant and contain seeds, even though they're often sterile. So in a botanical sense, yes, bananas are fruits. But sometimes people use the term \"fruit\" in a culinary context, referring to sweet, edible parts. Bananas are commonly eaten as a sweet fruit in that sense too. The user wants a straightforward answer without explanation, just a boolean. So the answer should be true. I need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted with the key \"is_fruit\" and the value as true. No other text, just the JSON object.\n"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.006546747,"prompt_tokens":58,"prompt_time":0.002266512,"completion_tokens":176,"completion_time":0.371875544,"total_tokens":234,"total_time":0.374142056},"usage_breakdown":null,"system_fingerprint":"fp_78ac7f3229","x_groq":{"id":"req_01k14erzzfenvszdm11611cb5z"},"service_tier":"on_demand"}
